            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </note> when as it is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and communicable, becauſe it multiplies it ſelfe, and increaſes the happineſſe of many in whom it is; ſo vice and ſinne is ſo much the more ſinfull and pernicious; by how much the more it diffuſeth and ſpreadeth it ſelfe as a common Plague or Leproſie to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and deſtruction of many, and utter ruine of all humane ſocieties. In which regard this ſinne of lying, of which I now purpoſe (God aſſiſting me) to intreate, may challenge unto it ſelfe a ſpeciall preheminence aboue almoſt all other vices, there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17130:6"/> being none more common and univerſall, whether wee reſpect perſons, times, or places. It begunne with our firſt Parents as ſoone almoſt as they had their beginning, who no ſooner left their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and integrity, than they left their Truth; and falling into ſinne, they fell to lying, hiding it in this darke ſhade, and covering it under this blacke vayle, becauſe they ſaw it ſo foule and loathſome, that they were aſhamed to bring it unto the light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For being asked by God why they hid themſelves from his Preſence among the trees of the Garden, they alleadge two falſe cauſes, and conceale the Truth. The one, was becauſe they heard Gods Voyce, which made them affraid; the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw their owne nakedneſſe; whereas they had often before heard God ſpeaking unto them and were not terrified, and had ſeene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked and were not aſhamed; neither was it their want of cloathing, but of the robe of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and their ſinne that brought this ſhame and feare. And from their loynes this corruption is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally propagated to all their Poſterity: from their ſinfull breaſts wee have all ſucked this deadly poyſon, which hath ſo generally infected the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature of all Mankinde, that there is ſcarce any vice or ſinne unto which we are more inclined, than unto this of lying.</p>
               <p>The which will better appeare, if wee conſider <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>That all Nations and conditions of Men are ſubject to this vice,</hi>
                  </note> that there is no Country or Nation, no place, age or condition of Men, priviledged and exempted from this contagion; no people ſo rude and ſavage, but have attained to the Art and skill of lying and diſſembling; none ſo well civilized and inſtructed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17130:6"/> in morall vertue, governed and reſtrained from vice by politique lawes, but that they often breake their bounds, and take unto themſelves a licentious liberty to ſpeake untruths for their advantage; yea no Nation ſo well nurtured and taught in the knowledge of God and his true Religion, but that the moſt of them are tainted with the contagion of this vice; and though they make ſome conſcience of other ſins, as murther, whoredome, drunkennes, fraud, oppreſſion, and the like, yet they are nothing ſcrupulous to uſe their beſt skill in lying, when as they thinke that it is for their gaine and advantage. And therefore though ſome people more than others, either by a naturall inclination, example or cuſtome, doe exceede in this vice, and (like the Cretians in the Apoſtles time) may by way of eminency be called Lyers; yet there are no ſorts <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 12.</note> of Men ſavadge or civill, Pagans, Turkes or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which are not too much addicted to this baſe and pernitious vice.</p>

And now it is eſteemed an high point of prudence, either cunningly to reſerve themſelves in a grave and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſilence, and concealing their owne thoughts and intentions to lye upon the catch, that they may take all advantages for the diſcovering of others
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17130:7"/> ſecrets; or ſo to ſpeake and diſcourſe, as that their words may not lay open their mindes, but rather miſlead their hearers into falſe conceits and errors: Men not caring, ſo that their maine end and aime be good, though they neglect Truth, when it will not ſerve for their purpoſe ſo well as a lye.</p>

And where ſhall we finde Truth more neglected, diſcountenanced and betrayed, than amongſt thoſe who would ſeeme to pleade for it? where have lyes and untruths more frequent and familiar en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment? For how few among that profeſſion that make conſcience to bee intertained in a bad cauſe, and having taken upon them the patronage of it, make any ſcruple to uſe their uttermoſt abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to dazell and blinde the eyes of the Judge; not onely by their Art and skill, but alſo by ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king untruths, when they will advantage their ill cauſe?

                  </note> all ſorts and conditions of men in our Land, yet amongſt none more than our Citizens, ſhopkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and artificers. For doe we not ſee that they in their Trade of buying and ſelling doe alſo make a common Trade of lying? And ſo they may utter their wares, they are content by ſinning to ſet their ſoules to ſale, giving them in as an over-meaſure and (as it were) an advantage to the bargaine; neither doe they more dazle the eyes of the buyer with their falſe lights, than the eyes of their mindes and judgements with their falſe praiſes, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly affirming that there are none ſo good in the towne, when as themſelves know that they have much better in their owne ſhops; that they coſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17130:9"/> them ſo much, when as afterwards they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſell them for leſſe; that they would not abate any thing of that price to their owne father or mother, though ſoone after they agree to take leſſe of a ſtranger; and that none but they ſhould have had them ſo good cheape, though perhaps this bee the firſt, and it may bee the laſt time that they ever ſaw or ſhall ſee them. Yea they are not content to uſe only their naturall faculty of lying, but ſtrive alſo to perfect it with art, and bend all their wittes daily to improve their skill; helping themſelves by their obſervation and experience to know and diſcerne what methode and skill of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they finde moſt advantageable. Nay they are not content to goe on themſelves in theſe wayes of darkeneſſe, but they will compell their ſervants and apprentiſes to goe together with them in the ſame wicked courſes, and now in theſe dayes take great ſummes of money to teach them their art, in which if they profit not, they are in no eſteeme, as being dull and heavie headed fellowes; ill chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and altogether unfit to deale with their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers. And though they above all others cannot indure lyes in their ſervants in any matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne themſelves, when as they tend to their hurt and damage, nor that they ſhould cover their faults committed in the Family by ſpeaking untruthes, and therefore will endeavour to breake them of this vice if they bee given to it; yet they will not onely ſuffer, but alſo teach them to lye in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary trading; as though lyes to deceive others were commendable, but hatefull when they are uſed to beguile them; lawfull and laudable in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17130:9"/> ſhop, but odious and intolerable in any other part of the houſe: wherein they groſly deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for he that maketh no conſcience of lying in one place, will make as little in another: hee that will not ſticke to lye for his maſters pleaſure and profit, will as eaſily adventure on it to hide his owne faults, that hee may eſcape ſhame or puniſhment; and hee that by the dayly practiſe of lying in the ſhop commeth to a cuſtome and habit, can hardly leave it in the hall or chamber. But let ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters tremble to thinke that hereby they bring Gods wrath upon them, not onely for their owne ſinnes, but alſo for the ſinnes of their ſervants, in which they are not acceſſaries alone but even prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals: and what a fearefull account they have to make at the Day of Judgement for poyſoning of youth committed to their charge with this vice of lying and deceit, making them hereby ſubject to Gods wrath and liable to that woe and heavie judgement denounced againſt ſuch ſervants, as <note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 9.</note> fearing man more than God, doe enrich their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with their lyes and deceit. I have enlarged my ſelfe the more in ſhewing how this ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth in the City, becauſe being ſo generall, yet few lay it to heart as a ſinne againſt God and man, but rather applaude themſelues in it as the excellency of their skill in their trade; whereof belike it was that in former times Trades were called Myſteries and Crafts, becauſe this myſtery of iniquity was practiſed in them, and all craft and deceit uſed in their buying and ſelling: or rather being good words in their prime ſignification, they came into diſcredit by their abuſe in their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17130:10"/> trades, and craft became a word of ill report and taken in an ill ſenſe, by reaſon of that cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning deceit which was uſed in Crafts and Occupations. And now I ſhould ſpeake no more of this vice amongſt Tradeſ-men, if I did not obſerve another kinde of lying practiſed by ſhopkeepers, which with griefe and bowels of compaſſion I have obſerved to bee moſt pernitious, as being joyned with grievous oppreſſion; namely that when their poore worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (by whoſe art and skill, labours and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours they are enriched) come unto their ſhops and offer them their worke and wares to ſell for the reliefe of themſelves and families, they put them off and ſlight their commodities, telling them that they need them not, becauſe they would beat them downe to a low and baſe price, by working upon their preſſing neceſſity; whereas in truth they want and need to buy them, and to procure them would runne to their worke-houſes, if their urgent wants (as a goade in their ſides) did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to outrunne them and prevent their haſte. Yet howſoever theſe men deſerve to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied as oppreſſed, yet they cannot bee cleared as innocent, ſeeing they likewiſe uſe the ſame arts and ſlights of lying which I haue before condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the other, and having made falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull worke and wares, they cover uſually their faults and defects in workemanſhip with untruths, affirming them to bee perfect and good, durable, profitable and every way for their turne that buy them, when as themſelves know that they are bad, ſlight and good for nothing. So that in reſpect both of the one and other, wee have juſt cauſe to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17130:10"/> complaine of our Citizens and towneſ-men in this land, as <hi>Ezechiei</hi> did ſometime of Jeruſalem: <hi>She hath wearied her ſelfe with lyes, and her ſcumme went</hi>

                  <hi>is in the midst of deceit, &amp;c.</hi> And yet let me not bee here miſtaken, as though I judged all men in theſe places alike and under the ſame guilt; for I know that there are many of them that truely fearing God, doe make conſcience of all their words and wayes, dealing as they would bee done by, and in their trading and converſation, abhorring to ſeeke their advantage by lyes and deceit; but I ſpeake onely of the greater part, and of the uſuall and common practice of the moſt in theſe dayes.</p>

                  </note> as though they were innocent, nor ſuppoſe that I acquit them becauſe I have not hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and reproved them. For I doubt not but thoſe that are converſant with them, and are daily witneſſes of their words and dealings, doe finde them as faulty in their kinde, as crafty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, as forward to advance their ends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their deſires with untruths and lyes, and as cunning to deceive in their buying and ſelling, their contracts and bargaines, by ſetting trueth to ſale at the cheapeſt rate, as thoſe that live in townes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17130:11"/> and Cities. Yea rather as they for the moſt part are more rude and untaught, ſo they are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this vice, and leſſe aſhamed when they are taken in it, than thoſe that are civilized and better inſtructed. Although perhaps they offend more ſeldome than Citizens, becauſe they are not expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſo many tentations as thoſe that ſpend their whole time in buying and ſelling, unto which this ſinne of lying ſticketh as cloſe as the ſhirt to the backe, or the skinne to the fleſh. And this <hi>Salomon</hi> obſerved that the buyer uſually diſprayſeth in words, what he liketh and approveth in his heart. <hi>It is naught, it is naught (ſaith the buyer) but when hee is gone his way, then hee boaſteth of his bargaine.</hi> And <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 14.</note> the ſonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> telleth us, that <hi>as a naile ſtickes</hi>

                  </note> ſo in no perſons more than in inferiours, as children and ſervants, who being not ſo carefull to avoid the committing of faults, as being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hide and cover them, leſt they might here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by incurre the juſt diſpleaſure of their Superiours, and ſo bring upon themſelves deſerved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doe uſually uſe lying, that under this covert they may keepe them from being diſcovered. Yea having told one lye they are ready to ſecond it with another, and that with a third and fourth, not caring to fall into a greater ſinne to excuſe a leſſe, and to make the wound of conſcience more deepe and deſperate, by doubling and redoubling of their fault; whereas an humble and penitent confeſſion would be accepted of their Governours, as a good
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17130:11"/> part of ſatisfaction; being more pleaſed with their acknowledgement which giveth ſome hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment for the future, then diſpleaſed with the fault it ſelfe. But let ſuch take notice of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſolly, whileſt they runne headlong into greater evills out of a bare hope to avoid the leſſe, which often deceiveth them and maketh their faults more haynous and unexcuſable. For what is the diſpleaſure of mortall man which they indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoide, in compariſon of the wrath of the immortall GOD which they certainely incurre? What are the momentany corrections and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments inflicted by men, in compariſon of thoſe torments eaſeleſſe and endleſſe in that Lake <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 8.</note> which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which are threatned by God, and ſhall moſt certainly be ſuffered, unleſſe they be prevented by unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?</p>

               <p>And ſo I come from the name to ſpeake of the <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>Of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that is in a Lye.</hi>
                  </note> nature of the thing deſcribed. In which the firſt thing conſiderable is the falſity and untruth that is in every lye. The which is twofold: Firſt, when that is falſe which is ſpoken. Secondly, when as Men ſpeake the Truth falſely, that is, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deceive. Now he ſpeaketh falſe who doth not ſpeake as the thing is, whether hee thinketh it true or noe; or whether he purpoſeth to deceive, or not to deceive; and he ſpeaketh falſelye, who doth not ſpeake as hee thinketh, whether that hee ſpeaketh bee true or falſe. The one is a Logicall untruth, when as the ſpeech agreeth not with the thing: the other a Morall lye, or a lye againſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, when as the minde agreeth not with the ſpeech. He that ſpeaketh that which is falſe, but yet thinketh it to bee true, cannot bee ſaid to lye, though he ſpeaketh an untruth; becauſe his ſpeech agreeth with his minde, and as hee thinketh hee ſpeaketh: onely it is his errour, either through the weakeneſſe of his reaſon, and underſtanding, and defect in judgement; or elſe through raſhneſſe, incogitancie and negligence; becauſe he doth not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17130:14"/> duely conſider and examine what he ſaith, before hee ſpeaketh it. If the former, it is not ſo much a ſinne, as the puniſhment of ſinne; or if a ſinne in the ſtricteſt cenſure, yet but onely as it is a branch of the corruption of nature, or originall ſin. The other muſt bee acknowledged and bewayled as a ſinne of infirmity, if it be done ſeldome and at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares; though nothing ſo haynous and odious unto God as a lye. But he that ſpeaketh willingly that which he knoweth to be falſe, or doth ſpeake the Truth falſely, that is, either when through er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and miſtake hee thinketh it to bee falſe; or knowing it to be true that he may deceive, or may be better beleeved when he lyeth, he is a lyer and herein reſembleth the Devill; who either lyeth in ſpeaking that which hee knoweth to be falſe; or elſe when hee ſpeaketh Truth, doth it with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deceive, or that hee may gaine the more credit to his lyes. And thus he called our Saviour Chriſt <hi>the Holy one of God;</hi> and his Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 1. 26. Act. 16. 17.</note> and <hi>Silas, the ſervants of the moſt high God,</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would deceive the people and make them to ſuſpect them the more, becauſe of his teſtimony and approbation, as though they were friends to his kingdome of darkeneſſe, or that he might bee the rather beleeved, when hee ſhould afterwards ſlander and reproach them as ſeducers and falſe teachers. Now which of thoſe two, he that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that which is falſe with a purpoſe to deceive, or he that ſpeaketh the Truth to the ſame end, bee in greater fault, it is not eaſie to determine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe how much the leſſe the one hath of Truth in his ſpeech who ſpeaketh that which is falſe, ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17130:14"/> much the more the other hath of craft and deceit, who can cunningly force Truth even againſt its nature to advance his falſe ends.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appeareth that there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>Of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between lying and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an untruth.</hi>
                  </note> betweene lying, and telling or ſpeaking a lye or untruth; for in a lye the tongue diſagreeth from the minde, and falſely ſpeaketh contrary to that which the minde thinketh, and therefore lyeth though that bee true which is ſpoken, becauſe it is conceived and thought to be otherwiſe: but when a Man ſpeaketh that which is a lye or untruth being perſwaded that it is true, hee lyeth not, becauſe his minde and tongue agree together, and he thinketh what he ſpeaketh, but hee onely erreth and would not willingly deceive, but that himſelfe is firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; ſo that ſuch an one cannot be ſaid to be a lyer, ſeeing he mindeth, affecteth and loveth Truth, but is onely miſtaken in what hee ſaith through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, raſhneſſe or incogitancie. And of this judgement are the ancients. So <hi>Bernard:</hi> there is <note place="margin">Eſt qui dubiè profert men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium nec mentitur: &amp; eſt qui veritatem quam neſcit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmat, &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur, &amp;c. <hi>Bern. in Cant. Serm.</hi> 17</note> (ſaith hee) that telleth a lye doubtingly and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and there is that affirmeth the Truth which he knoweth not, and lyeth; for he indeed ſaith not that to be which is not, but yet affirmeth that hee beleeveth that which in Truth he beleeveth, and he ſaith Truth, although that be not true which he beleeveth. But the other when he ſaith that he is <note place="margin">Non eſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candus mendax qui dicit falſum quod putat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quiaquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in ſe eſt non fallit, ſed fallitur, &amp;c. <hi>Anſelm. in</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> certaine of that whereof he is not certaine, ſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Truth, although that be true which he affirmeth. So Saint <hi>Anſelme:</hi> Hee is not to bee judged a lyer, who ſpeaketh falſe thinking it true, becauſe as much as in him lieth hee deceiveth not, but is deceived; and contrariwiſe, hee lyeth who
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17130:15"/> ſpeaketh Truth, thinking it to be falſe. For hee is not free from a lye who ſpeaketh true things with his mouth, not knowing them to be ſo; but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he lyeth in his will. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Quiſquis autem hoc enunciat quod vel credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum animo vel opinatum tenet etiamſi falſum fit, non menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp;c. <hi>Auguſt. contra mendac. ad Conſentium. cap.</hi> 3.</note> much to the ſame purpoſe; whoſoever (ſaith hee) ſpeaketh that which either hee beleeveth or thinketh in his minde, doth not lye although it be falſe. For this hee oweth to the declaring of this faith, that hee uttereth by it that which is in his minde, and ſo conceiveth it as he uttereth it. But hee cannot bee ſaid to be in no fault although hee doth not lye, if hee either beleeveth things not to be beleeved, or thinketh that he knoweth what he knoweth not, although it be true: for hee taketh things unknowne as knowne; wherefore he lyeth, who conceiveth one thing in his minde, and utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth another thing by his words, or any other ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications. From whence hee that lyeth is ſaid to have a double heart, a double cogitation: one is of the thing which hee knoweth or thinketh true, and doth not ſpeake it; another is of the thing which hee ſpeaketh in ſtead of this, knowing or thinking it to bee falſe. Whence it commeth to paſſe that a man may ſpeake that which is falſe, and yet not lye, if he thinketh it to be ſo as he ſpeaketh, although it be not ſo; and that he may ſpeake that which is true and yet lye, if thinking it to be falſe, he ſpeaketh it for a Truth, although indeed it bee ſo as hee ſpeaketh. For a man is to bee eſteemed a lyer or no lyer, according to the meaning of his minde, and not according to the Truth or falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the things themſelves. And therefore he that ſpeaketh that which is falſe for true, thinking
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17130:15"/> it to be ſo, may be ſaid to erre or to be raſh, but he cannot bee truely ſaid to bee a lyer; becauſe when he thus ſpeaketh, hee hath not a double heart, nor deſireth to deceive, but is himſelfe deceived. And in another place ſpeaking to the ſame purpoſe hee ſaith: neither by any meanes is he free from a lye, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Enchirid. ad Laurentium. cap.</hi> 17.</note> who with his mouth ſpeaketh the Truth not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be ſo; becauſe knowingly hee lyeth with his will, &amp;c. and he is better who not knowing it, ſpeaketh falſe, becauſe he thinketh it true, than he that willingly hath a minde to lye though hee ſpeake Truth, not knowing it to be true which hee ſpeaketh, &amp;c. The like alſo may be ſaid of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as <hi>P. Martyr</hi> affirmeth, when as a man making <note place="margin">1 Sam. 21. 12.</note> them purpoſeth to performe them, but afterwards doth not; either becauſe hee cannot through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, which hee foreſaw not when he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; or will not upon ſome preſſing neceſſity and much altering of the caſe from what it was. As when an able man promiſeth to pay a debt at ſuch a day, and in the meane time is diſabled by ſome unexpected loſſe. So when one promiſeth to lend a ſumme of money to one whom he taketh to be an honeſt man and able to repay it at ſuch a time, and in the meane while it appeareth that hee is an unthrift who will conſume it in drinking or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; or a diſhoneſt banke-rupt, who will make no conſcience to cheate him of it. Or if a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to lend his ſword to one that is ſober and in his right minde, and ſoone after he prove diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and frantique, who is likely therewith to kill himſelfe or ſome other: In theſe and ſuch like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a man lyeth not, though hee doth not performe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17130:16"/> what he promiſed, becauſe his minde and tongue agreed when hee made it, and the change is not from himſelfe, but from him unto whom hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, becauſe there is <hi>error perſonae</hi> an errour in the perſon, he not being the ſame man which hee was or ſeemed to bee when the promiſe was made. And thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is excuſed from a lye, when as hee ſaid that hee would goe into Spaine, <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 24, 28. 2 Cor. 1. 15, 17.</note> whither he went not; and promiſed the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, that at ſuch a time hee would come unto them, but did not performe it. In neither of which he lyed, becauſe when he made theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he did not diſſemble, ſpeaking one thing and thinking another, but ſpeaking then what he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards purpoſed to performe, God did in the mean while otherwiſe diſpoſe of him; whoſe diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on overruleth all, and is above all humane reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing conſiderable in the nature of <note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>That a lye is alwayes vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</hi>
                  </note> a lye is, that it is alwayes voluntary, the will reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the minde in a knowne Truth, and injoyning the tongue to ſpeake that which is contrary to it; the heart alſo and affections deſiring and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in it, either abſolutely or conditionally in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of circumſtances. So that if the will imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not an untruth as it is untrue, but onely as through errour of the minde and judgement it is preſented and commended unto it; and if the heart affecteth it not, nor delighteth in it as a lye, but onely as it is diſguiſed with ſome ſhaddow or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of truth, an untruth thus miſtaken cannot be accounted a lye, becauſe the will agreeth with the minde, and the tongue is directed by the will;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17130:16"/> ſo that though a man ſpeaketh a lye, yet hee is no lyer; becauſe he neither thinketh that hee lyeth, nor would willingly doe it if hee knew it to bee ſo. <note place="margin">Intereſt enim inter mentien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem; nam men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens eſt qui mentitur invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp;c. <hi>Ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> To this purpoſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> There is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence (ſaith hee) betweene one that telleth a lye, and one that is a lyer; for one may tell a lye that lyeth unwillingly, but a lyar loveth to lye, and dwelleth with his minde in the delight of lying.</p>
               <p>The third thing that concurreth in a lye is, that <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>That a lye is uttered with a purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
                  </note> it is an untruth, alwayes uttered with a purpoſe and deſire to deceive, and to make the party to whom wee ſpeake thinke that to bee ſo which is not. So that ſuch an untruth as is uttered without any purpoſe to deceive, is not to be eſteemed a lye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it aymeth not at that end which a lyer alwaies propoundeth. For howſoever ſome appropriate this end to pernicious lies that the lier intendeth it therein onely, yet indeed it belongeth alſo to thoſe lyes that are officious and in jeſt. It is true that there are ſome lyers that have a will and deſire to deceive him unto whom they ſpeake, without his loſſe, yea it may be for his profit and delight; as thoſe that uſe officious and merry lyes; and ſome lye with a will and deſire to hurt and endammage him, as pernicious lyers, but all agree in this that all would deceive, though the one for their good, the other for their hurt; for whoſoever ſpeaketh that which is falſe wittingly and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether it doth good or hurt, hee alwayes ſpeaketh it to this end, that the Truth may not be underſtood by him that heareth him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to deceive him. I ſay it is his next end to deceive (although his remote end at which hee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17130:17"/> aimeth, bee to delight or profit him) which hee uſeth as a meanes to attaine unto his deſire. As when a Phyſitian telleth his ſicke Patient that the potion which he willeth him to take is ſweete and pleaſant, though intruth it be bitter and loathſome, that ſo hee may perſwade him to drinke it for the recovery of his health, the maine end at which herein hee aimeth is the welfare of the ſicke Man, but the next end is to deceive him, by telling an untruth, which he uſeth as a meanes to further the other end of curing him, which is principally in his intention and deſire.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing in the definition to bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">§. 7. <hi>Of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manner and meanes whereby a lye is expreſſed.</hi>
                  </note> of, is the divers manner and meanes whereby a lye is expreſſed and committed; and that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſitively and directly, when as the Truth is contradicted and oppoſed, or elſe privatively and indirectly, when as it is ſuppreſſed and betrayed. The former is done by any outward ſignification of the inward notions and thoughts of the minde, eſpecially by our ſpeech and actions. By our ſpeach a lye is expreſſed and committed, when as wee ſpeake otherwiſe than that which wee conceive in our mindes, either affirming that to be which wee thinke is not, or denying that to bee which (as we conceive) is. By our actions, when by our outward ſhowes, geſtures and deeds, wee deceitfully faine, diſſemble and diſguiſe the Truth, that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our neighbour, by making him to thinke that to bee which is not, or that not to bee which is; and to conceive by our outward ſhewes and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age that wee intend that which is leaſt in our thought, to this end that wee may deceive and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17130:17"/> hurt him. Secondly, a lye is committed privative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indirectly, when as the Truth is ſuppreſſed and betrayed, and that is done when as by ſilence it is concealed at ſuch times, and before ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wherein and before whom, wee are bound in conſcience to reveale and confeſſe it, for the glory of God, and good of our neighbours. For truth and falſhood being contraries without meane, the ſuppreſſing of the one, is the exalting of the other, and we may bee truely ſaid to lye when wee deny the truth, and to deny it when wee conceale it by ſilence at ſuch times as wee are lawfully called to confeſſe it. And therefore our Saviour (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by his antitheſis and oppoſition) maketh this to be all one, to deny him and not to confeſſe him; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſſe mee before men, him will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 32, 33.</note>

And therefore, fitly doth the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> in that Catalogue of <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 8.</note> ſinners, which ſhall have their <hi>part in that Lake which burneth with fire and brimstone,</hi> ranke the <hi>fearefull</hi> with <hi>lyers,</hi> becauſe as the one bely the truth, ſo the other through their cowardize and infidelity dare not confeſſe it, which is all one as to betray and deny it.</p>

                  </note> concurre in every Lye, whereby it appeareth that divers formes of ſpeaking which are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and accuſed as lyes, are acquitted and cleared hereof at the Barre, before the ſeat of Juſtice, by a right ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of true judgement, as namely hyperbolicall ſpeeches, fables, parables and ironies. In all which though there bee not the ſame ſpoken which is meant, punctually and literally, yet the ſame in the ſenſe and intention of the ſpeaker, in whom there is no will to lye or ſpeake contrary to the truth with a love and delight in falſhood, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers expreſſion of the ſame truth conceived in the minde, in other words and phraſes than are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, namely ſuch as are tropicall, metaphoricall, parabolicall and hyperbolicall, not onely for the greater elegancy, but alſo for the more profit of the hearer; and not to blinde him with untruthes, or deceive him with lyes; but rather the better to convince him of the truth, and to move him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it with greater profit and delight. As firſt for hyperboales or hyperbolicall ſpeeches which is the raiſing of things to their higheſt pitch, and the inlarging of them above all due proportion,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17130:18"/> not to deceive, (for then ſome meaſure ſhould bee obſerved to make the thing probable and credible) but to expreſſe the conceits of the minde in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary loftineſſe of ſpeech, not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the hearer, but for the more full informing of him of the truth for his greater profit. As alſo when wee give to things ſenſeleſſe or inanimate motion and life, yea ſometimes the uſe of reaſon. Of the former are ſuch ſpeaches as aſcribe a kinde of infiniteneſſe to things finite; as when ſpeaking of a multitude, we ſay commonly that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable like the ſands of the Sea, of long laſting things, that they are everlaſting and without end; of thoſe that are of great quantity or capacity, that they are immenſe and above all meaſure. And ſuch phraſes are uſed in the Scriptures, as that the Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites were ſo cunning in the uſe of their ſlinges, <note place="margin">Judg. 20. 16.</note> that they could caſt their ſtones at an haires bredth and not miſſe; that the ſinnes which the faithfull <note place="margin">Pſal. 137. 18.</note> confeſſe themſelves to have committed, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove not onely the haires of their head in number, but even the ſands by the Sea ſhore; and that if all things which Chriſt did ſhould bee wtitten, the <note place="margin">John 21. 25.</note> whole World would not containe the volumes that ſhould bee written. By which ſpeeches no man can be deceived, ſeeing if they were taken li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, there were no ſhaddow or ſhew of truth in them; but rather the truth which they perſwade is the more cleared and inforced, namely that the Benjamites were exceeding cunning in the uſe of their ſlings; that the ſins confeſſed were a number almoſt numberles, and the actions done by Chriſt were very many, more than the Evangeliſt had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17130:19"/> recorded. Of the other we have many examples in the Pſalmes and Prophets, as when the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are ſaid to skip, the Flouds to clap their hands, the Earth to heare the Word of the Lord; which cannot be taken in their proper ſenſe, but onely as Rhetoricall phraſes, expreſſing the trueth according to the intention of the ſpeaker in a lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of ſpeech, for the better underſtanding of the hearer and affecting of him with more delight. Neither can they be eſteemed lyes, becauſe they doe not deceive the hearer or reader, ſeeing they doe not beget a falſe conceit in his minde, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe him to conceive and imbrace the trueth with greater admiration. So S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <note place="margin">Quicquid au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem figuratè fit aut dicitur non eſt mendacium, &amp;c. <hi>Contra men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dac. ad Conſent. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> is done or ſpoken figuratively is not a lye. For every enunciation or ſignification is to be referred vnto that which it ſignifieth to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thoſe unto whom it is uttered: otherwiſe (as he ſaith in another place) all tropes and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors which are not taken in a proper but borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed <note place="margin">

The which manner of ſpeaking though it bee often abuſed unto ſinne, as ſcoffing, ſcorning, deriding; yet is it lawfull in it ſelfe and to us alſo, when it is rightly uſed, not to deceive, but the better to cleare the trueth, to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſinne, and to convince offenders of their faults and errors; neither hath he that ſo uſeth it, a will to lie or deceive, but to ſignifie the trueth in an improper way, that it may bee received with more delight.

               <p>Finally, upon the ſame grounds we acquit and <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>Parables acquitted from the cenſure of lying.</hi>
                  </note> exempt from lying; firſt, Parables, whereby the trueth of things is ſignified and repreſented unto
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17130:20"/> us by fained ſtories of other men and their actions, wherein the circumſtances are ſo fitted, as though they had been truely done, that by them the truth may bee ſignified, as it were in reall words, and portraied in living and ſpeaking pictures for the better convincing of the hearers to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the trueth, when they without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie may judge of it in other mens perſons, as we ſee in <hi>Nathans</hi> Parable to <hi>David;</hi> and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> to the Scribes and Phariſees concerning the vineyard let out to thoſe unjuſt farmers that killed the heire to get poſſeſſion of it; which drew <note place="margin">Matth. 21. 33, 41.</note> from both a juſt ſentence againſt their owne ſinnes, which they would rather have minced and excuſed, if directly and plainely they had beene charged with them. So alſo they ſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to dazle the underſtanding, when they are darkely propounded and not applied to uſe, the which our Saviour uſed, when hee ſpoke to thoſe whom in juſt judgement he would have heare and not underſtand; ſometimes to make what is ſaid more cleare and evident when things are illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch examples as are common and familiar; by which as the hearer is made docible and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of what is taught, ſo are the things learned much the better imprinted in his memorie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any lie in ſuch formes of ſpeech, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of the ſpeaker is not to deceive the hearer, but rather to diſcover the trueth in a more familiar manner, the minde and tongue agreeing together, and ayming at the ſame end, although the words muſt not be taken as proper and direct, but by analogie and way of ſimilitude.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:17130:20"/>
               <p> Not much unlike unto theſe is the way of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>Of fables and poeticall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and that they are not to bee reputed lyes.</hi>
                  </note> by Fables and Poeticall fictions, in which, beaſts and birds, yea, trees and plants are brought in ſpeaking and reaſoning one with another; which were purpoſely invented to teach men ſome politicke leſſon or morall inſtruction, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be made more wiſe or more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, provoked to ſome good dutie, or made more cautious in ſhunning ſome evill either of ſinne or puniſhment, which fabulous tales cannot juſtly be reputed lyes, becauſe he that telleth them ſpeaketh the truth, though not in a proper and literall ſenſe, yet in the reaſon and morall of his ſpeech; and becauſe it is not his purpoſe to deceive his hearer, but to teach him the truth in an eaſie and familiar manner, that it may bee better conceived and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. In which reſpects fabulous tales are of beſt uſe when as they are told to rude and ſimple people, who not being capable of arguments, ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes and demonſtratiue reaſons, give no heede unto them, but when the truth is repreſented in a fabulous tale which they underſtand, being allured with the noveltie of the thing, they liſten unto it, that they may know what will be the iſſue, and ſo at unawares are taken with the reaſon and morall of it, when as ſtronger reaſons would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them. And being informed in the trueth the leſſon which they have learned is more firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted in their memorie; for things which are ſtrange and pleaſant doe extraordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and being delightfull are not eaſily forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And of ſuch fables we have examples in the Scriptures; as that of <hi>Iotham,</hi> who by that fable of <note place="margin">Judg. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:17130:21"/> the trees, convinced the people of their ungrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and folly, in preferring ambitious and wicked <hi>Abimelech</hi> before all the ſonnes of <hi>Gedeon</hi> who were vertuous and modeſt. And that of <hi>Iehoaſh</hi> in which he reſembled <hi>Amaziah</hi> to a Thiſtle and himſelfe to <note place="margin">2 King. 14. 9.</note> a Cedar, that by the inequalitie of their ſtrength hee might diſſwade him from provoking him to battaile. And ſuch was the fable of <hi>Menius Agrippa</hi> to the mutinous people of Rome, about the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement betweene the reſt of the members of the body with the belly or ſtomacke, whereby hee perſwaded them to come backe and joyne with the Senators. The which kinde of fables are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as being no lyes, but repreſentations of truth under fictions, and not to deceive the hearer, but to draw him on more eaſilie to the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth; onely in them that deviſe them care muſt bee had to avoide all obſceaneſſe and ſcurrilitie, becauſe as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, ſuch <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> rotten ſpeeches doe corrupt good manners. For whereas it may be objected, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 4.</note> condemneth thoſe that turne away their eares from the truth, and hearken unto fables, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to give heede unto them; and <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 4. 2 Pet. 1. 16.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that hee had not followed cunningly deviſed fables, they doe not ſpeake of all fables, but onely of profane old wives and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fables, which did not tend to edification and inſtruction in the knowledge of the trueth, but onely by pleaſing the eare to fill the minde with unprofitable vanities and miſleade the judgement into errors and lyes. And that he ſpeaketh of ſuch onely and not of the other which have their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 7. Tit. 1. 14.</note>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus have I ſhewed what a lye is, <note place="margin">§. 1. <hi>That ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems in war are lawfull.</hi>
                  </note> the nature thereof, the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in it, and what formes and kindes of ſpeech are ſuſpected for untruths, but cleared from this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition. And now for concluſion of this point two queſtions come to bee reſolved. Firſt, what is to be thought of ſtratagems in Warre; by which I underſtand ſuch ſleights and policies, either by words or actions, as are purpoſely deviſed and practiſed to circumvent and deceive an enemie; where as one thing is pretended to conceale the truth, and another thing is intended, but coloured and covered with ſome ſubtile device. To which I anſwere that it is lawfull by all juſt and honeſt policies to circumvent an enemie in a lawfull war, either by word or action. For if it be lawfull by ſtrength of armes to ſpoyle, kill and utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, then alſo to uſe the ſtrength of our wits and all good policies which may conduce to the obtaining victorie, eſpecially conſidering that here there is no falſehood or treacherie, under ſhew of love and amitie, but an open denouncing of hoſtilitie, by which both ſides profeſſe, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17130:22"/> they will uſe the uttermoſt of their indeavour to ſupplant one another both by ſtrength and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; by which generall profeſſion both ſides have ſufficient warning to expect the uttermoſt that can be done by power or wiſdome for their ruine, and conſequently to prepare themſelves and (as it were) to countermine againſt them for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of their deſignes, and to catch them if they can in their owne wiles. And this as it is warranted by reaſon and nature, that in our owne defence or juſt and neceſſarie offence, wee ſhould uſe all good meanes to deſtroy them who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would deſtroy us; ſo alſo by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that both by the examples of pious and religious Kings and Captaines, as <hi>Ioſua, David</hi> and divers others; and alſo by the commandement of <note place="margin">Joſh. 8. 2. 2 Sam. 5. 23.</note> God himſelfe, injoyning them to uſe ſuch politicke ſtratagems. And with this alſo agreeth the law of Nations and the law of Armes, that all meanes may bee uſed both apertly and profeſſedly, and alſo ſecretly and cunningly, as ambuſcadoes and ſubtile devices for the ſurprizing of Cities and Forts, masked and diſguized under ſhewes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of ſuch things as are not really inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Neither is there in all this any falſehood or unjuſtice, but onely an indeavour to conceale the truth, when as being unſeaſonably profeſſed, it would become hurtfull and pernicious to our ſelves and countrie.</p>
               <p>But yet ſome caution muſt here be obſerved, <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>That the former point is to be held with ſome caution.</hi>
                  </note> namely, that though wee take lawfull libertie in theſe ſtratagems and martiall policies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the trueth from an enemie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet that wee doe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17130:22"/> not, under any pretence or to advance any end, tell direct lies, and much leſſe confirme them by falſe oathes and imprecations; and leaſt of all muſt we hold it lawfull to breake and nullifie our promiſes and covenants made with enemies, either for the concluding of peace, or a truce and ceſſation from armes and hoſtility for an appointed time, or kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of quarter, or any other courſe agreed upon for the right ordering and managing of the warre to the good of both parties, and tending to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of common wealths and humane ſocieties. The which is to be abhorred of all Chriſtians, yea though ſuch breach of promiſe might be coloured and excuſed by equivocations, mentall reſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or any other pretence whatſoever; ſeeing ſuch lyes and falſifying of promiſes are not onely moſt diſhonourable unto God, eſpecially when as by oath he is brought in as a witneſſe to a lye, but alſo moſt hurtfull to humane ſocieties and common wealths, when as this chiefe bond of peace and juſtice is violated, ſeeing none thus deceived would be willing afterwards to truſt another, or to make truce or peace upon any conditions, when as they can have no aſſurance that they wil be obſerved and performed. Yea ſuch lyes and breach of promiſes are above all moſt pernicious to the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeing through Gods juſt judgement they are either taken in their owne net and miſcarry in their enterpriſe, or have the ſame meaſure from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meaſured unto them, who taking them upon advantage falſifie their faith to them whom they have found faithleſſe. For he that is Lord of hoaſts and God of battailes, <hi>Who giveth ſalvation to Kings</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 10.</note>

                  <hi>and delivereth</hi> David <hi>his ſervant from the hurtfull ſword,</hi> is alſo the God of truth; and therefore as wee may expect that hee will crowne Juſtice and Truth with conqueſt and triumph; ſo that he will execute vengeance upon lyers and not ſuffer falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to goe unpuniſhed. The like may be ſaid of ſpies and intelligencers, who if any other, might in many reſpects pleade for a liberty in lying. But howſoever it may bee lawfull for ſuch to diſguiſe themſelves and their intentions, and to uſe all good policies to conceale an unprofitable and unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable truth, yet it is in no wiſe lawfull for them to uſe meanes that are evill and ſinnefull to effect their deſire, as to deny the truth, renounce their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make profeſſion of a falſe religion, as Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, Mahumetiſme, Popery, by going to Maſſe, and joyning with them in any ſuperſtitious ſervice; or finally by telling lyes, or uſing any other falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to deceive and blinde their eyes with whom they converſe, that they may atchieve their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes the better, when as they live among them unſuſpected.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is concerning ſimulation <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>The ſecond queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundedand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, and firſt of ſimulation lawfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</hi>
                  </note> or faining, and diſſimulation or diſguiſing. Simu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is, when by word, action, or any other ſigne that is fained to be which is not. Diſſimulation is when as by any of theſe means any thing is diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and hid, which in truth is. Now the queſtion is whether either of theſe can be judged lawfull and juſtly acquitted from being a lye. For the former, we muſt anſwer by diſtinction; for either the thing fained hath no being at all, either in reality and truth, or in reaſon and ſignification; or elſe though
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17130:23"/> it have no exiſtence properly and in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, yet it hath an improper and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative being by which it ſignifieth and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth ſomething that is. If the thing fained have no being at all, then is it all one with a lye; but though it have no being in reality, yet if it haue a being in the reaſon of the thing, and bee brought to ſignifie, demonſtrate and illuſtrate ſomething that is, then is it no lye, but wholly tendeth to the ſetting forth of truth: and of this kinde are many poeticall fictions, fables, apologies and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. So Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> not all that which wee <note place="margin">Non omne quod ſingimus mendaciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt, ſed quando id ſingimus quod nihil ſignificat, &amp;c. <hi>Quaeſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangel. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 51.</note> faine is a lye, but then it is a lye, when as we faine that which ſignifieth nothing. But when our ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is referred to ſome ſignification, it is not a lye, but ſome figure of truth; otherwiſe all thoſe things which are ſpoken figuratively of wiſe and holy Men, yea even God himſelfe ſhould bee thought lyes, becauſe according to common underſtanding truth is not in ſuch ſpeeches. As for example, the parable of the prodigall was not really and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, but figuratively and in the reaſon and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of it. So our Saviours comming to looke for fruite on the figge tree when the time of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring was not, had in it no reall intention to finde fruite upon it, ſeeing every one might know that in ſuch a ſeaſon it could have none; but it was fained, that (as it were) under this reall parable, he might ſignifie that they who brought forth no <note place="margin">Fictio quae ad aliquam veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem refertur figura eſt: quae non refertur mendacium eſt <hi>Aug. ibid.</hi>
                  </note> fruites were under the curſe. And therefore (as he ſaith) a fiction which is referred to ſome truth is a figure, and that which is not thus referred is a lye. Secondly, wee may diſtinguiſh of the purpoſe and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17130:24"/> reſolution of our minde and heart of doing or not doing what we faine and make ſhew of. For either it is abſolute, or conditionall. Now if in ſhew or words I faine that I will doe that which I have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely reſolved not to do, then doe I lye, whether I doe or doe it not, becauſe my words and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations diſagree from my minde and heart. But if my reſolution were onely conditionall, then it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon the performance of the condition, and I may doe a thing reſolved on, or not doe it without lying, as the condition is obſerved or not obſerved. As for example, if I goe to a friendes houſe with a reſolution to returne home to my owne ſupper, if he doe not uſe ſome importunity in deſiring me to ſtay ſupper with him: then if I faine that I will goe home and uſe ſome earneſtneſſe that I may take leave, I lye not if I goe away, though I deſired to ſtay, being not at all, or but ſleightly intreated; nor yet if I ſtay, though I made ſhew that I would depart, if importunity bee uſed; becauſe my reſolution was conditionall, and I was truely purpoſed to depart, if not earneſtly invited, or to ſtay and ſuppe with my friend, if he inſtantly deſired it. Laſtly, wee may diſtinguiſh of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ends which they that faine do aime at in their faining. For either their aime is to deceive their neighbour in making him to beleeve that which is not true, or to doe him ſome other hurt; or elſe that they may hereby benefit themſelves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The former is to be reputed a lye, yea ſuch a lye as is hurtfull and pernicious: as when men faine themſelves to be pious and religious, when as in truth they are impious and prophane, the which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17130:24"/> is damnable hypocriſie, and this fained piety, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iniquity; or when outwardly by their words and ſhewes they faine love and friendſhip when as their hearts are full of enmity, that they may get the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunity of revenge, and executing their malice. Theſe men lye in their faining, ſeeing their minds diſagree from their words and ſhewes, and becauſe alſo their end and aime is to deceive and hurt.</p>
               <p>Now theſe diſtinctions being received will <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>Divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation objected and cleared.</hi>
                  </note> ſerve to cleare ſome places of Scriptures objected to maintaine unlawfull faining; as firſt that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels themſelves fained when <hi>Lot</hi> intreating them to come into his houſe, they refuſed ſaying, <hi>Nay, but we will abide in the ſtreete all night,</hi> contrary <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 2.</note> to what they purpoſed, for afterwards they were content to lodge with him, and ſo no doubt were reſolved to do before he requeſted them. I anſwer, that their purpoſe was not abſolute, but upon the condition of his earneſt intreaty, which if hee had not vſed, they would not have tarried; for ſo it is ſaid, that when they refuſed, <hi>hee preſſed upon them greatly, and ſo they turned in unto him, and entred into</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>his houſe.</hi> Secondly, it is objected that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelfe fained, when as travelling with his Diſciples to Emaus, hee made as though hee would have gone further which hee intended not, for afterwards being intreated, hee ſtayed with them, and hee knew beforehand that they would thus intreat him. To which ſome anſwere, that this his making as though hee would goe further, is to bee referred not to Chriſts intention, but to the opinion and conceit of his Diſciples, who ſeeing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17130:25"/> him ſtill goe on thought that hee had purpoſed to proceed in his journey, and therefore ſtayed him with their earneſt importunity. But though this would not ſtand good, ſeeing unleſſe Chriſt had ſhewed ſome purpoſe of going, they ſhould not have needed to have conſtrained him upon this reaſon, that it was too late to travell, the night approaching; yet the former anſwere will ſerve, that it was his purpoſe to ſtay, yet not abſolutely, but upon the condition of their importunity which hee knew they would uſe, neither did hee herein (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerveth) faine any thing which was falſe, ſeeing hee was indeed a ſtranger upon earth, and was not here to ſtay, but to goe further till hee came into his owne Countrey and Heavenly Kingdome. Neither was it his end to deceive, but to convince the Diſciples of the truth, as of their incredulity, of the neceſſity of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, for the redemption of his People, and of the certainty of his reſurrection. Laſtly, it is objected that <hi>David</hi> being in the Court of <hi>Achiſh</hi> fained <note place="margin">1 Sam. 21. 13.</note> himſelfe mad, that he might eſcape the danger of his life. To which I anſwere, that though <hi>David</hi> were an holy Man, and according to Gods owne heart, yet he had his failings and infirmities as well as others; and therefore we muſt not in all things propound him unto our ſelves as an example for our imitation. It is true that this fact and fault of his may admit of ſome excuſe and extenuation, namely that he thus fained, not out of any love or liking of this courſe, but tranſported and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great and ſudden feare by the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of imminent danger, wherein hee ſhewed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17130:25"/> much weakeneſſe of faith; ſeeing hee had ſpeciall promiſes that God would keepe him in all his wayes, and notwithſtanding the malice of all his enemies would ſettle him upon the Throne and give unto him the Crowne and Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The like alſo may be ſaid of diſſimulation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>Of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, lawfull and unlawfull.</hi>
                  </note> wee hide and diſguiſe that which is, the which is either lawfull or unlawfull; lawfull when as we onely diſſemble and hide the truth, but doe not deny or falſifie it with a lye, neither uſe it to hurt or deceive our neighbour, but for his profit and benefit; not to lead him into errour, but to reſerve our ſelves, and to conceale our good counſells and intentions, that they may ſucceede the better and not be hindered by their diſcovery. And thus our Saviour Chriſt the eternall Sonne of God diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and hid his Divine nature under the vaile of our fleſh; not by denying, but by not diſcovering that he was God, and hindering alſo his Apoſtles <note place="margin">Matth. 17. 9.</note> from making it knowne till after his reſurrection; which hee did not with a purpoſe to deceive men, but that hereby hee might further their ſalvation by laying downe his life as the price of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. The which his counſell would not have beene effected, if it had beene diſcovered, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people would not have killed and crucified him, <hi>had they knowne him to be the Lord of Glory,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. And thus alſo God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8. Act. 3. 17. Job 42. 2. John 21. 17. Heb. 4. 13.</note> doth graciouſly diſſemble our ſinnes, not that he doth not ſee and know them, for hee knoweth all things and they lye open and naked in his ſight, but becauſe hee will take no notice of them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them unto us for condemnation. And thus
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17130:26"/> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> laudably diſſembled his diſpleaſure when hee <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 27.</note> was deſpiſed and neglected by the ſons of <hi>Belial;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> his juſt indignation againſt <hi>Shemei,</hi> that <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 22.</note> by this his clemency hee might more firmely knit unto him the hearts of his revolted people. And thus may we lawfully diſſemble ſuch wrongs and injuries as have beene offered us by ſuch friends, as we are willing ſo to forgive, as that wee are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to call them to account; either becauſe wee would not grieve their hearts by ſuch repetitions, or would not make them ſuſpicious of the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our love out of the apprehenſion of their owne guiltineſſe. Thus alſo wee may diſſemble the good parts of our neighbour, when as taking notice of them will but make them proud; and much more our owne, which though it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to deny as being truth, yet in modeſty ought to bee diſſembled, ſeeing it is vaine glory to vaunt of them, or to bee Trumpets of our owne prayſe. Unlawfull diſſimulation is when as it is joyned with untruth, or is uſed to deceive or hurt our neighbour, ſeeing it is oppoſed not onely to Truth and Juſtice, but alſo to candidous ingenuity, and honeſt ſimplicity. As when men hide and diſguiſe their malice, under the ſhew of love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that they may get the fitter opportunity to take ſharpe revenge, as we ſee in the example of <hi>Abſolon</hi> towards <hi>Amnon,</hi> and of <hi>Ioab</hi> towards <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa.</hi> Or when they diſſemble their pride and ambition under the ſhew of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and Affabilitie, that becomming popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, they may rayſe themſelves into the ſeate of Honour, as wee ſee in <hi>Abſolon,</hi> who by theſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17130:26"/> cunning ſubtilties ſtole the hearts of the People from his Father, and made way for his owne uſurpation.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut for the better clearing of this point <note place="margin">§. 1. <hi>In what caſes it is lawfull to conceale and diſſemble the truth.</hi>
                  </note> let us further conſider whether it bee lawfull to ſuppreſſe, hide or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Truth in whole or in part, and in what caſes it is lawfull or unlawful. For the underſtanding whereof, I will ſet downe this concluſion, that it is lawfull to conceale the Truth, (if it bee not masked with a lye) in whole or in part; when the Glory of God, the good of our neighbour either publike or private, and our owne good in particular doth require it; and utterly unlawfull when it is otherwiſe: for though it be not lawfull at any time to deny it, yet is it both lawfull and expedient to conceale it in ſuch caſes by our ſilence, or any other way which is not ſinnefull. And thus ought wee to conceale the truth in whole, if we be left to our ſelves and not neceſſitated to declare it, or in part if wee bee examined, making uſe of that part which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale to bee as a cover or colour to hide that part which we conceale, which being diſcovered would impeach and hinder Gods Glory, or our owne and neighbours good. An example whereof wee have in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> who being examined by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The example of</hi> Jeremie.</note>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:17130:27"/> and asked what king <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> ſaid unto him, he confeſſeth the Truth in part, namely his ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the king, that hee would not ſend him backe to <hi>Ionathans</hi> houſe to die there; but concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his counſell in adviſing him to yeeld up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and the Cittie into the hands of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 38. 27.</note> becauſe this diſcovery would not have condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the former ends, but onely have exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Princes againſt both the King and Prophet, and cauſed them to croſſe this counſell, if he ſhould afterwards reſolve to follow it. Now if any except againſt this, that <hi>Ieremie</hi> might doe it through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and that therefore it is no preſident for us to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The example of</hi> Samuel.</note> follow, we have another example above all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, namely of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who by God himſelfe <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 2.</note> was appointed, by uttering one part of truth, to conceale the other, if the matter ſhould come to bee examincd, and to ſay (if his going to <hi>Ieſſe</hi> his houſe came to <hi>Sauls</hi> eare) that the end of his going was to offer ſacrifice, that ſo hee might hide from him the other part, which was the maine end of his going thither, namely to annoint <hi>David</hi> King in <hi>Sauls</hi> ſtead.</p>
               <p>And thus (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thinketh) <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>The ſpeach of</hi> Abraham <hi>in calling</hi> Sarah <hi>his ſiſter, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
                  </note> may bee acquitted of telling a lye, when hee ſaid that <hi>Sarah</hi> was his ſiſter, ſeeing ſhee was his neere kinſwoman, who according to the uſuall ſpeech of the Hebrewes were called ſiſters. Neither did he ſay; She is not my wife, but ſhe is my ſiſter, the which was no lye but the truth, being rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. And ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe excuſeth it, <hi>yet indeed ſhee is my ſister, ſhe is the daughter,</hi> that is, the Grandchilde <hi>of my Father, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17130:27"/> (ſaith hee) <hi>Abraham</hi> concealed ſomething of the truth, but ſaid nothing that was falſe, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed that ſhe was his wife, and ſaid that ſhee was his ſiſter. And it is not a lye when the truth is <note place="margin">Non eſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium, cum ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendo abſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur verum, ſed cum loquendo promitur falſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Contra mendac. ad Conſent. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> concealed by ſilence, but when by ſpeaking wee utter that which is falſe: unto which might bee added that <hi>Abraham</hi> had no will to lye, nor deſire to deceive, but to preſerve his owne life, and the people with whom hee converſed, from the ſinne of murther. But (ſaving his better judgement) theſe reaſons alleadged doe not juſtifie <hi>Abraham</hi> as innocent, but onely thus farre excuſe his fact, that it was a fault of infirmity into which feare, and not maliciouſneſſe thruſt him. For there is great difference betweene the fact of <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and this of <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſeeing they concealed onely one part of truth and acknowledged another; but he in the ſame ſpeech uttered (as I may ſay) a truth and untruth; a truth in the reality of it, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth in his intention: a truth in ſome ſenſe, as himſelfe underſtood it, but not in that ſenſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee would have them to conceive it; for it was his purpoſe in ſpeaking it to make them falſly to thinke, that ſhee was onely his ſiſter, and not his wife, or elſe it would not have ſecured him from that danger which he feared. And a ſpeech is not true, when as it is ſo in a reſerved ſenſe, but when it is ſo in that ſenſe wherein wee would have the hearer to take it. And ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpeech could not be true, but a plaine equivocation, which is no better than a lye, for in ſaying that ſhe was his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, his deſire was that they ſhould conceive that ſhee was not his wife. And though it were not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17130:28"/> 
                  <hi>Abrahams</hi> abſolute and free will to ly, yet it was his will by accident, as he thought himſelfe neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hereunto to ſave his life, and though it were not his principall and maine end to deceive by ſpeaking untruth, but to eſcape the danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing killed; yet it was his next and mediate end which he uſed to advance the other. Neither doth <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpeach to the King imply that hee was wholly faultleſſe, but rather the contrary. For if hee had ſpoken a cleare and ingenuous truth, in ſaying that ſhe was his ſiſter, why ſhould he excuſe it, that he did it not upon free choyce, but becauſe hee was neceſſitated thereunto being in danger of his life? And his ſaying <hi>that indeede ſhee was his ſiſter,</hi> tendeth not wholly to acquit him of all fault, but onely to extenuate it, ſeeing ſhe was ſo truely in ſome ſenſe, though not in that where in he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they ſhould underſtand him. Finally, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> even by the light of nature diſcerned that notwithſtanding <hi>Abrahams</hi> excuſe, <hi>Sarah</hi> had equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated in ſaying that ſhe was his ſiſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Gen. 20. 16.</note> reproved her for it, becauſe it was ſuch an untruth as had expoſed her to the danger of being defiled. But though it be unlawfull to lye or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, yet it is lawful to conceale the truth, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſilence if we be not examined, or to conceale it in part if wee bee queſtioned, ſo that the other part which wee ſpeake be not onely true in it ſelfe <note place="margin">Non autem hoc eſt occultare veritatem, quod eſt proferre medacium, &amp;c. <hi>Contra mendac. ad Conſentium lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> and in our owne ſenſe, but alſo in his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to whom we utter it, or at leaſt as we deſire to have him underſtand it. And of this judgement is Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelfe elſe where: It is not all one (ſaith he) to hide the truth, and to tell a lye;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17130:28"/> for although every one who lyeth deſireth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale what is true, yet not every one lyeth who willeth to conceale it. For very often we conceale things that are true, not by lying, but by our ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Neither did our Lord lye when hee ſaid, <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you, but as yet yee cannot</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 16. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>beare them.</hi> He concealed truthes, but did not ſpeake untruthes, becauſe hee judged ſuch truthes as yet unfit for them to heare.</p>
               <p>But let us examine this queſtion yet more fully <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>That the truth of Religion is to be confeſſed when wee are lawfully called thereunto.</hi>
                  </note> and diſtinctly, in what caſes the truth is to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or concealed, and when the Glory of God and good of our neighbour, or our owne good, doth require the profeſſion of it; and when wee ſhould conceale and hide it by ſilence or otherwiſe. For the underſtanding whereof wee are to diſtinguiſh of truth, namely that it is either religious or civill. Religious truth is the truth of religion, or the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith; the which we are upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to profeſſe being lawfully called thereunto, when the Glory of God, or good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour doth require it, according to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter; Sanctifie the Lord in your hearts, and be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>ready alwayes to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekeneſſe and feare.</hi> Neither is it enough to beleeve the truth and keepe it to our ſelves, but we muſt alſo openly profeſſe it: for as <hi>with the heart man beleeveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>righteouſneſſe; ſo with the mouth confeſsion is made unto ſalvation,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us. For if wee conceale the truth when wee are called to profeſſe it, we doe not onely deny the truth, but alſo the Lord of Truth, who is the Author and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17130:29"/> Patrone of it, <hi>and whoſoever ſhall deny him before</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 10. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>men, him will he deny before his Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But when are wee called lawfully to make this confeſſion of truth? ſurely at all times when by our confeſſion wee may glorifie God, or benefit our neighbours. As when wee are called before a lawfull Magiſtrate and required an account of our faith, then wee muſt in no caſe ſuppreſſe the truth, though we confeſſe it with the danger of our lives: for he ſtandeth in Gods ſtead as his Deputy, and to hide or deny the truth before him is (as it were) to deny or hide it in Gods ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And then alſo God is glorified by our Chriſtian apology, when as wee will not ſhrinke from the truth whatſoever we ſuffer for it. So alſo we are bound to profeſſe the truth of our religion before private men, when as wee conceive that thereby wee ſhall glorifie God by propagating his Truth, and edifie them to whom wee confeſſe it. Otherwiſe if there be no cauſe why we ſhould conceive this hope, becauſe we know them to bee ſcorners and enemies of Gods true Religion, who would but deride it and our profeſſion, wee may, yea in Chriſtian diſcretion wee ought to conceale it, ſeeing we ſhall by our confeſſion diſhonor God by expoſing his Truth to contempt, and wrong our owne perſons by laying our ſelves open to ſcorne and deriſion, if not to the danger of their rage and violence. For which wee have our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſts Word for our warrant; <hi>Give not that which is Holy unto Dogs, neither cast yee your Pearles</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 7. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>before Swine, leſt they trample them under their feete, and turne againe and rent you.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:17130:29"/>
               <p> Secondly, there is a civill truth which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>That civill truth is to bee confeſſed, when Gods glory or our neighbours good doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</hi>
                  </note> about the affaires of this life, the which alſo is to bee ſpoken and profeſſed, when the glory of God and our owne and neighbours good doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, or to bee hid and concealed when by the profeſſion of it God is diſhonoured and our ſelves and neighbours endammaged. Now if we further enquire when Gods glory and our owne and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good doth require it to be ſpoken, and when it ought to be concealed, wee are to diſtinguiſh of it, either as it is to be ſpoken publikely before the lawfull Magiſtrate ſitting judicially upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate, or privately to ordinary men in our common courſe of converſation. When wee are judicially called before the lawfull Magiſtrate, and required according to law to ſpeake the truth, we ought not to conceale it, whether it bee for us or againſt us. And for this wee have the ſame reaſon that we have for ſpeaking of religious truth; for the Magiſtrate ſitteth in the place of God as his Deputy to enquire and examine the truth, and therfore to deny or diſſemble it unto him in a legal maner inquiring after it, is (as it were) to deny and diſſemble it unto God himſelfe; the which in this reſpect is the more grievous ſinne, becauſe in courſe of law men are examined upon oath and are bound thereby to ſpeake not onely the truth, but alſo the whole truth, in which they call God as Witneſſe to what they ſay, and ſo groſly abuſe his Majeſty being the God of truth, if they draw him, as much as in them lyeth, to countenance and confirme a lye. Secondly, hereby they tranſgreſſe in a high degree Gods expreſſe Commandement, by which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17130:30"/> as he forbiddeth us to beare falſe witneſſe in the negative part, ſo in the affirmative hee requireth that we ſpeake the truth to his glory and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good. Finally, wee ſinne againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth and againſt all good policy, order and government, which cannot ſtand if in theſe legall <note place="margin">Uterque reus eſt, &amp; qui veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem occultat, &amp; qui mendaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um dicit: quia &amp; ille prodeſſe non vult, &amp; ille nocere deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Ad <hi>Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanum.</hi>
                  </note> proceedings the truth ſhould bee denyed or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. In all which reſpects Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaketh fitly to our purpoſe; either of theſe are guilty and faulty, both hee that hideth the truth, and he that telleth a lye, becauſe the one denyeth to profit, and the other deſireth to hurt.</p>
               <p>Upon which grounds and reaſons I conclude, <note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>That the Truth muſt bee confeſſed before the Magiſtrate, when hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall manner.</hi>
                  </note> that being convented before a lawfull Magiſtrate, and by him examined, we are bound in conſcience to ſpeake the truth and whole truth, if he proceed legally and in judiciall manner, and demand of us ſuch things as we may anſwere unto piouſly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſhonouring God, and juſtly without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Church and Common-wealth, or wrong to any particular perſon. For if ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions bee propounded as are not lawfully deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor we bound by the Law of God and of the Common-wealth to anſwere, wee may in ſuch a caſe refuſe, and conceale the truth. So likewiſe when the diſcovery of it tendeth to Gods diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to the hindering or ſuppreſſing of his true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to the hurt and dammage of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, by betraying unto the enemy the ſecrets of State; or the delivering of the innocent into the hands of impious and unjuſt men that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſeeke their ruine, and the taking away of their goods, liberties and lives, we are not bound
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17130:30"/> to anſwere the truth of the things demanded, yea wee ought in ſuch caſes to hide and conceale it, though it bee with the extreame and imminent danger of our goods, liberties and life it ſelfe. As for example, when in the times of perſecution wee are examined by wicked tyrants; whom we know to be of our religion, or who were preſent with us and accompanied us in ſuch a place, and at ſuch a time in Gods divine Service, Prayer, and hearing of the Word; we ſhould in ſuch a caſe indure any loſſes and tortures, rather than betray them into their hands that ſeeke their lives. But though wee may not diſcover the ſecrets and counſells of the innocent when it tendeth to their hurt and ruine; yet wee may and ought to confeſſe, when wee are examined to reveale the faults and crimes of thoſe that are guilty and have offended againſt the Lawes of God or the Land, yea though wee have beene copartners with them in their wickedneſſe, and by ſolemne promiſe or oath have mutually bound our ſelves to ſecrecy, becauſe ſuch oathes and promiſes are unlawfull, as tending to Gods diſhonour, the hindring of Juſtice, the nouriſhing of Vice, and the great prejudice of Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>But here another queſtion commeth to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>Whether malefactours are bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to confeſſe the truth, thogh it bee with the hezard of their lives.</hi>
                  </note> whether a man that is guilty of a fault or crime that concerneth his life, being examined in a Legall manner before a lawfull Magiſtrate, bee bound in conſcience to confeſſe the Truth, and ſo by accuſing himſelfe to indanger his life. To this I anſwere, that every one who is guilty is bound to teſtifie the Truth, if he be required by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17130:31"/> Magiſtrate, though it bee with the hazard of his life, and ſinneth if he hide his fault with a lye; and better it is to expoſe the body to the danger of death by confeſſing the Truth, than by lying and ſinning to offend God, and caſt both ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into Hell. But yet men thus guilty are more or leſſe bound to confeſſe the truth and accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and doe ſinne more or leſſe haynouſly by concealing it in divers caſes and conſiderations. For if the Judge having no evidence of Truth, nor competent witneſſes to cleare the cauſe, and direct him in giving a right ſentence, doth ſeriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the offendor, charging him upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to teſtifie the Truth that God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, when he his Deputy doth Juſtice; and if thus ſtrictly examining him, hee doth in ſome degree reſt upon his teſtimony for his direction and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſuch a caſe the guilty perſon ſinneth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he conceale the truth or hide his offence with a lye; for Judgement being the Lords, hee diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth him, that hindreth the execution of juſtice with a lye.

                  <hi>Achan</hi> in a waighty cauſe, willeth him to give Glory unto God by confeſſing the Truth, implying hereby that hee ſhould much diſhonour him if hee did otherwiſe.

                  </note> and miſleadeth the Judge, and cauſeth him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert juſtice, and to pronounce an unrighteous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>But if (as it is in our judiciary proceeding) the queſtion bee asked, whether the offender at the Barre be guilty or not guilty, hee is not ſo ſtrictly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17130:31"/> bound as in the former caſe to confeſſe the Truth, nor ſinneth ſo much if hee doth conceale it. For in this caſe the Judge greatly regardeth not the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the perſon arraigned, when he pleadeth not guilty, thereby to bee directed in paſſing his ſentence, but onely in a Legall proceeding he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth this queſtion; that in a formall and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner he may put himſelfe upon another try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, namely of the Jewry, who are in no ſort dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the offenders teſtimony, but by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of competent witneſſes and evidence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Neither doth our law in theſe criminall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of life and death, binde an offender to accuſe himſelfe, nor inflicteth any puniſhment, if hee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to doe it. Yea rather if pleading not guilty he put himſelfe upon tryall of his Countrey, he hath a faire and ſometime favourable proceeding and iſſue, being often acquitted, when being guilty he hath deſerved puniſhment; whereas if he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the truth by ſilence, and refuſing to put his cauſe upon tryall, doth condemne himſelfe as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe hee will not uſe the Legall forme in pleading not guilty, he hath no favour of law, but is adjudged to greater and more torturing puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than if he were found guilty by the Jewry, or his owne voluntary confeſſion. Againe, there is great difference betweene the offences which are confeſſed or concealed; for if in themſelves they are haynous and capitall, both by the morall Law of God, the law of Nature and Nations; as Treaſons, Parricides, Murthers and the like; for which every naturall Conſcience will condemne the offenders as worthy of death; then doe they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17130:32"/> much more haynouſly ſinne, if being examined by a lawfull Magiſtrate they conceale the Truth, and excuſe themſelves by telling lyes. Yea in ſuch caſes it is probably thought that if there were no other to bring theſe haynous crimes to light, they are bound in conſcience, that Juſtice may be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, to diſcover and accuſe themſelves. But if the offences be ſuch as are not capitall by the morall Law, and the Law of Nations; but are onely made ſo by the Poſitive lawes of particular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, which admit rather of a particular miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, than a generall inconvenience, and reſpect in their puniſhments the univerſall good of the Common-wealth, more than the demerit of the offender; puniſhing with more ſeverity leſſe faults, which being through the diſpoſition of the people inclining thereunto, more commonly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the hurt and damage of the whole State, than greater offences which being rarely commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bring no ſuch prejudice; then is it much more tolerable and leſſe ſinnefull, when the offenders by pleading not guilty doe put themſelves in a Legall forme upon tryall of the Jury, in hope to be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their verdict, when the law affords them no favour upon their confeſſion. As for example, in the caſe of ſtealth and ſmall thefts which the Law of God puniſheth not with death, but reſtitution; yet is ſo puniſhed by poſitive lawes with all ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe it is generally neceſſary that it ſhould ſo be for the preſervation of the Common-wealth, although in ſome particular caſes, there may bee a lawfull and conſcionable mitigation of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in Legall proceedings that reſpect the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17130:32"/> common good more than the preſervation or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of ſome private perſons, cannot bee ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed by inferiour Magiſtrates, who are bound to judge according to law, if the offender confeſſe his fault and plead guilty: In ſuch a caſe I ſay, it is more excuſable if the truth bee concealed by ſuch a deniall, as is to be underſtood onely as a forme in pleading, whereby he putteth himſelfe upon a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall tryall, that he may have the favour of the law, for the remitting of his ſmall offence, and not as a reall, cordiall, and reſolute deniall of the truth: For when they plead not guilty, it is not much unlike in ſenſe, though different in words; as if they ſhould ſay, I will not diſcover my faults by acknowledging my ſelfe guilty and accuſe my ſelfe, ſeeing the law doth not require it, but I will for my purgation put my ſelfe upon tryall, and ſtand (upon the examining of witneſſes) to the verdict of the jury, to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted or condemned according to their evidence directing their Conſcience.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed how it is lawfull or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient <note place="margin">§. 8. <hi>Of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the truth to private men.</hi>
                  </note> to confeſſe the truth when as wee are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a legall manner before a lawfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: now concerning the confeſſing or concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it in our private converſation, the caſe is much different, ſeeing therein we have a liberty to utter or hide it from thoſe that have no authority to examine us, according as our occaſions ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and Chriſtian prudence direct us. It is true that commonly and ordinarily we muſt ſpeake that truth with our tongues which our minds conceive, becauſe they were given us to this end that they ſhould be as faithfull Interpreters of our hearts to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17130:33"/> diſcover our thoughts one to another, but yet this is no farther required than as in our ſpeech we may be uſefull and profitable one to another. In which regard it is not onely lawfull but very expedient that wee ſhould conceale the truth in many caſes from thoſe that have no authority to examine us of it. And thus wee may, yea ought to conceale ſuch ſecrets as are intruſted to our keeping, when as they are lawfull, as alſo the faults and infirmities of our neighbors, ſeeing love doth cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſins; yea to diſcover them when we are not neceſſitated thereunto by ſome great and neceſſary cauſe, doth not onely ſhew want of love, but alſo of honeſty and juſtice, which requireth that wee ſhould doe unto others, as we would have them to doe unto us. And the like alſo may be ſaid of our owne faults and infirmities, which wee ought by all lawfull meanes to hide and conceale from all men, unleſſe it be to our ſpirituall Phyſicians, that they may the better cure us, or to our weake Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients troubled and afflicted in minde, that we may comfort and cure them, by making our ſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples unto them of the ſame infirmities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they thinke none ſo troubled as themſelves. Otherwiſe, except it be in theſe and ſuch like caſes, it is not only permitted as lawfull, but required as expedient and neceſſary to hide and conceale our owne ſinnes and infirmities. For firſt whereas in the ninth Commandement in the affirmative part, God injoyneth us to uſe all good meanes, both by giving a true teſtimony and alſo by our ſilence whereby we may preſerve the good name of our neighbour, ſetting forth their virtues and good
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17130:33"/> parts, and concealing their faults and failings; he requireth alſo the ſame at our hands for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our owne fame and reputation, for charity begins at home, and the love of our ſelves is the rule of our love towards our neighbours. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it may bee objected, that this Commandement injoyneth us to give a true teſtimony, whether it be with or againſt us; and that God requireth that every man ſhould <hi>ſpeake the truth to his neighbour;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 8. 16.</note> to this I anſwer, that affirmative precepts though they binde us alwaies to performe the duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, yet not at all times, but when it is ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and profitable for Gods glory, and our owne and neighbours good. And as the Prophet requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that wee ſhould alwayes ſpeake the truth to our neighbour, ſo the Apoſtle teacheth how it <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 15.</note> muſt be ſpoken, namely in love. Secondly, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary and unſeaſonable diſcovery of our owne faults and infirmities tendeth to Gods diſhonour, who as he is <hi>glorified when we bring forth much fruit,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 15. 8. Matth. 5. 16.</note> and have the <hi>light of our holy lives ſhining before men:</hi> ſo is hee diſhonoured by our evill conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and his holy Name blaſphemed by thoſe that are without, when they diſcover our ſins and corruptions: for the vices and faults of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30. 2 Sam. 12. 14.</note> doe often redound to the diſcredit of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Thirdly, the diſcovery of our faults and fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, tendeth to the diſgrace of Gods true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no which wee profeſſe, when men that are wtihout diſcover in us ſuch evill fruits, and to the diſcredit of our Chriſtians profeſſion, ſeeing they are apt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute them rather to our religion and profeſſion, than to our naturall corruption, and are willing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17130:34"/> through the ſides (as it were) of our fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to wound the Goſpell. Fourthly, hereby we ſhall become ſcandalous and ſtones of offence to thoſe that are weake, and thoſe alſo that are not yet called; encouraging the one to fall into the ſame vices and ſinnes by our evill example, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the other from entring into the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our religion, when as they heare us ſay well, but ſee that we doe no better. Laſtly, hereby we ſhall ſinne againſt our ſelves in blaſting and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing our good name with juſt aſperſions; and whereas it ſhould bee in higher eſteeme with us than <hi>great riches,</hi> and ſweeter than the moſt odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1. Eccl. 7. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>oyntment,</hi> wee ſhall deprive our ſelves of this pretious jewell by unneceſſary diſcovery of our faults and failings. Neither can wee, when we have once opened a breach, ſtay at our pleaſure the current and ſtreame of mens ſuſpitions; but when we have ſpoken much, they will bee apt to thinke that we could ſay more, ſeeing every one is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo favourable to himſelfe, that he will ſpeake the leaſt of that which he knoweth will tend to his prejudice and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the ſecond queſtion whether it bee lawfull in whole or in part to conceale the <note place="margin">§. 9. <hi>Of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and mentall reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </note> truth, and in what caſes it is to bee approved as good, or diſallowed as evill: unto which this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe would require that I ſhould adde a third, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning equivocations and mentall reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are not onely in continuall practice among the Papiſts, but alſo warranted and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by their doctrine. But I ſhall not neede to ſpeake any thing in this point, ſeeing it is already
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17130:34"/> fully and learnedly handled of late by a reverend <note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Henry Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> Divine in this Citty. Only let me briefly ſet downe my judgement of it, namely that ſuch equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and mentall reſervations, are not onely lyes, but in this reſpect of the worſt ſort; in that there lieth lurking in them the greateſt deceit, as being masked with the ſhew of truth. For not onely that which is falſe is in them affirmed both in his ſenſe that ſpeaketh as he deſireth to be underſtood, and in his that heareth in ordinary underſtanding, but alſo it is done wittingly and willingly, and to this end that they may deceive and miſlead men into errour; which if it were allowed would prove moſt pernicious, ſeeing it would overthrow all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and all contracts and dealings, publike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Common-wealths, and private, betweene Man and Man; ſeeing none could know how words or oathes are to bee underſtood, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not beleeve one another in what is ſpoken. And as they are pernicious in theſe and many other reſpects unto other men; ſo in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard moſt pernicious to themſelves; In that whereas other lyes are condemned by a naturall Conſcience, and ſo often repented of, theſe being maintained and defended as no ſinnes, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without remorſe, ſo that men live and dye in them without repentance.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE maine end of all my former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <note place="margin">§. 1. <hi>Of the outward cauſes of Lying, which are firſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</hi>
                  </note> hath beene to inform the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the true nature of a Lye, and to diſtinguiſh it from ſuch Truthes, as in outward ſhew and appearance may ſeeme to have ſome ſemblance of it, that ſo rightly diſcerning it, we may the better avoyde it: and yet not through our untaught zeale in ſhunning it, looſe our lawfull liberty in ſpeaking ſuch truthes as being cleare and candide inough in their owne nature, yet (like a faire greene tree neere unto a Smiths forge) are (as it were) dusked and obfuſcated with the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous ſmoke of lyes, by reaſon of their vicinity. For vertue dwelleth betweene its extreames, and the moſt unreconcileable enemies doe often border one upon another. And now in the next place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my order propounded, I am to ſay ſomething of the cauſes of lying, the which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward in others, or inward and in our ſelves. The chiefe outward cauſe is the Divell, who as he is a lyer from the beginning and the father of lyes, ſo doth he beget children after his owne likeneſſe, and indeavoureth to make them as great lyers, as himſelfe. And as by his lyes at the firſt hee mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Mankinde, ſo ever ſince hee maketh them murtherers of themſelves, by drinking dayly deepe draughts in this poyſoned cup of lying, which he putteth into their hands. Wherein alſo he ſheweth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17130:35"/> his deſperate malice againſt God himſelfe, in that not being able to reſiſt his Power, hee oppoſeth him as he is the God of Truth, gaineſaying what he ſaith, as wee ſee in his firſt tentation to our firſt Parents: For God having threatned death againſt them, if they did eate of the forbidden fruite, hee expreſſely contradicteth him, and ſaith, <hi>Yee ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>not die at all.</hi> And when he cannot impeach or hurt him in himſelfe in regard of his moſt abſolute and perfect being, hee adventureth upon us, and as it is reported of a kinde of Serpent called the <hi>Panther,</hi> that hee ſo maligneth Man, that when hee cannot hurt him, hee will flye upon and bite his Picture: So this old Serpent the Divell bearing an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate malice againſt God, when he cannot revenge himſelfe upon him, he flyeth upon his Image, that hee may deface it, blotting out of it its created Truth and Righteouſneſſe, and ſtamping upon it his owne image of lyes and falſhood.</p>
               <p>Another outward cauſe of lying is the World, <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>Of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond outward cauſe of lying, which is the world.</hi>
                  </note> whether we underſtand it of the Perſons of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked men, or of Worldly things. For world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men are the common teachers of lyes, both by their precepts, ſetting up (as it were) a Schoole of falſhood, and inſtructing one another in thoſe cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and politike arts of lying for advantage, and alſo by their practice; for the <hi>whole World lying in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 John 5. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh) but yet not willing to have it diſcovered, doe tell lyes in <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 2.</note> hypocriſie, as (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> foretelleth of the falſe teachers of the latter times) and commonly uſe the Art of lying to hide and diſguiſe their ſinfull courſes, not caring to commit any wickedneſſe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17130:36"/> which by lyes they can keepe from comming to light, whereby they become precedents and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to encourage one another in theſe wicked practices, which every one not reſtrained with the feare of God are apt to follow; partly becauſe being become ſo generall and univerſall, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome doth take away the conſcience of it, and the multitude of offenders, leaveth no place for ſhame, if they bee taken in the ſinne; and partly becauſe they ſee one another thrive by theſe lying Arts; ſo as they thinke with <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> that Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence favoureth their untruthes, ſeeing they are carried with ſo faire a gale of winde into the Port of their deſires. Yea worldly wicked men allure oftentimes one another with promiſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to afford mutually the helpe of a lye, when as it may advance their ends, and redound to their benefit and advantage; which if they refuſe, they <hi>become enemies</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>becauſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>they tell the Truth.</hi> And if they cannot intice them to ſwallow the hooke with theſe alluring baites of favour and friendſhip, they will not ſticke to drive them into their nettes with terrours and feares, watching all occaſions to doe them a miſchiefe, if they refuſe to ſatisfie their deſires. Finally, the things of the World, as honours, riches, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, are by way of object the uſuall meanes to draw men to lying, there being no kinde of lyes which the ambitious, covetous and voluptuous, will baulke, when they thinke them advantagious for the obtaining of their preferments, wealth and carnall delights.</p>
               <p>The inward Cauſe of lying is our owne corrupt <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes of Lying, namely the fleſh and fleſhly luſts: and</hi> 1. <hi>Ignorance and forgetfulneſſe of God.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:17130:36"/> fleſh and the ſinfull luſts thereof. For as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is a lyar and the father of lyes, ſo the fleſh is a lyar and the mother of this baſtardly brood, who receiving from Sathan this ſinfull ſeed, doth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it in her fruitfull wombe, conceiving, breeding and bearing it, untill it bee ſo multiplyed that it hath filled the earth. Neither is our corrupt nature more prone unto any vice than unto this of lying, nor yet giveth more full ſwinge unto any without remorſe or checke of conſcience, than unto it, if it be ſimply conſidered in it ſelfe, or produce any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and bee not made odious by ſome evill conſequents, or pernitious fruits which it bringeth to our neighbours or to our ſelves. And as the fleſh generally is the cauſe of lying, ſo is it in its particular luſts and the ſinfull fruits which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth. As firſt ignorance of God and his trueth, is a ſpeciall Cauſe of lying. For did we know and acknowledge Gods Omniſcience, whereby hee beholdeth all ſecrets, and taketh notice of not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the words of our mouthes, but alſo of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thoughts of our hearts, and diſcerneth how they differ one from another; his omnipotence, whereby hee is able not onely to kill the body of him that lyeth, as hee did <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> but alſo to caſt both body and ſoule into hell, and in the meane time to fruſtrate all our hopes and ends which we propound unto our ſelves in lying, either by detecting our untrueths, or by croſſing us in them, ſo as they ſhall not effect our deſires, but rather hinder them; and finally if wee did know that he is a God of trueth, who hateth and abhorreth lyes, and will according to his Word
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17130:37"/> give lyars their portion in that lake which burneth <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 8.</note> with fire and brimſtone, if they doe not prevent their juſt damnation by unfained repentance, wee would not take pleaſure in lyes, nor bee hyred to tell them with the baſe wages of worldly vanities. But it is our ignorance of theſe things that cauſeth us ſo eaſily to fall into this ſinne, when as Sathan or the World tempteth us unto it. And therefore the Prophet joyneth them together as the Cauſe and Effect: <hi>They bend</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>their tongue like</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>their bow for lyes; but they are not valiant for the trueth upon the earth; for they proceed from evill to evill, and they know not me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Another Cauſe is oblivion and forgetfulneſſe of God, for many that know Gods Nature and Attributes, and will acknowledge that he is omniſcient, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, juſt and true in all his Word and wayes, yet fall into this ſinne through forgetfulneſſe, not pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and conſidering what they know, when they ſhould make uſe of it to keepe them from ſinning. And of this the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>Of whom</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hast thou beene affraid or feared, that thou</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 57. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>hast lyed, and hast not remembred mee, nor laid it to thy heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third Cauſe of lying is our inordinate and <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>A third Cauſe is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate feare of men.</hi>
                  </note> immoderate feare of men more than of God; the which the Prophet implyeth in the ſame words; <hi>Of whom hast thou beene affraid, that thou hast lyed, and hast not remembred me</hi> whom thou haſt more cauſe to feare than all men or devils? For they at the moſt can <hi>but kill the bodie,</hi> but God can alſo <hi>cast bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule into hell.</hi> Neither is either man or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 28.</note> ſo able to protect us againſt the ſtroke of Gods
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17130:37"/> vengeance when wee ſpeake lyes, as hee is both able and willing to defend and preſerve us againſt all their might and malice whileſt wee make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſpeaking the trueth; for according to his gracious promiſe, <hi>Hee ſhall cover us with his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and under his wings ſhall we trust, his trueth ſhall bee our ſhield and buckler.</hi> But becauſe men looke onely unto the preſent and take care to avoid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, and live by ſenſe more than by faith, beholding the arme of fleſh ready to ſtrike them, and not the power of God which is all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to protect them, nor ſeeing him that is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; <hi>Therefore they make lyes their refuge, and hide</hi>

Amongſt the reſt they finde none more fitting for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than this of Lying, as being a ſpeciall helpe whereby they are inabled to ſupplant and deceive one another, and to enrich themſelves by their neighbours ruines; eſpecially when they have any entercourſe of Trading, buying and ſelling, in which all manner of deceit is uſed to defraude one another, and all diſguiſed and hid with theſe lying arts. So that as Covetouſneſſe is the roote of all <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 10.

The firſt diſtinction is taken from the cauſes: for either they proceede from the Divels tentation, or the Worlds inſtigation, or from the corruption of our owne fleſh, if at leaſt, theſe may be ſaid to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kindes in which theſe cauſes ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre and meete together.

In which diviſion I purpoſe to inſiſt, onely adding thereunto a fourth kinde, which is called <hi>mendacium mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi> or a modeſt lye, when men in a kinde of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility deny or extenuate their vertues and good parts. A merry lye is that wherein the lyer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth <note place="margin">A merry lye what it is.</note> this end onely, that hee may delight his hearer, and not deceive him, or ſo farre onely to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17130:40"/> deceive, as that thereby he may delight him. For there are ſome (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith) who <note place="margin">Contra men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentium. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.</note> deſire by their lyes to pleaſe men, not that they may injure or reproch any, but that they may bee ſweete and pleaſant in their talke. Now theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from other lyars in this, that they delight to lye, rejoycing in the deceit it ſelfe; but theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to pleaſe with the urbanity and ſweetneſſe of their ſpeech, who notwithſtanding, had rather pleaſe by uttering truthes; but when as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily finde true things which are acceptable to their hearers, they chooſe rather to lye, than to hold their peace. Now ſuch lyes are either ſo cunningly fram'd and coloured with likely hoods and ſimilitude of truth, that they deceive the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with their ſpecious ſhewes, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light him, when he diſcerneth the jeſt and findeth his errour; or elſe ſpun with ſo courſe a threed by the teller of them, having no probability or ſhew of truth, that the hearer plainely diſcovereth them, and is onely delighted with the artificiall abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and prodigious hyperboles of the tale, which tranſcend all truth and likelyhood. So that the hearer is no way deceived by it, knowing that it is ſpoken in jeſt to move delight. An officious lye is when as the ſpeaker wittingly and willingly utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note place="margin">An officious lye what it is.</note> an untruth, either out of Piety that hee may glorifie God, or out of Charity and love of Juſtice and Mercy, that he may thereby doe good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or his neighbour, either to prevent or free him, or himſelfe from ſome loſſe, danger, diſgrace, or other miſchiefe; or to procure unto either ſome profit and benefit; and that without the hurt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17130:40"/> or dammage of any other. A pernicious lye, is <note place="margin">A pernicious lye what it is.</note> when as the ſpeaker intendeth by lying not onely to deceive his hearer, but alſo to damnifie and hurt his neighbour in his perſon, name or ſtate, and that wittingly and willingly. In which kinde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre all the ſinnefull evils that are in a lye in the higheſt degree. For firſt, hee that thus lyeth, not onely ſpeaketh that which is falſe, but alſo falſely againſt his minde and knowledge. Secondly, hee thus ſpeaketh willingly, loving and delighting in his lye; and laſtly, with a purpoſe and deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and to doe hurt and miſchiefe by his deceit. In all which reſpects this ſort of lyes is above all others moſt abominable unto God, pernicious to our Neighbours, and damnable, to our owne ſoules. In the practice whereof men then grow to the higheſt pitch of this helliſh impiety, when with the Divell the Father of lyes, they not onely uſe them for profit or neceſſity, but alſo love and delight in them more than in the truth; like thoſe of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh. <hi>Thou loveſt evill</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 52. 3, 4.</note>

Neither is any deceit ſo dangerous as this in matters of religion, ſeeing this (as wee ſay) toucheth our free hold and leadeth us into ſuch errours as will hinder our ever laſting ſalvation.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus having ſhewed the diverſe <note place="margin">§. 1. <hi>Though ſome lyes are more ſinnefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than others, yet all ſorts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ninth Commandement</hi>
                  </note> ſorts of lyes, it now followeth that we examine whether any of them at any time or upon any occaſion, bee lawfull and warrantable? And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be denyed but that there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the degree of ſinfulneſſe betweene ſome ſorts of lyes and others; and that the guilt of merry and officious lyes is much extenuated by many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and conſiderations, by their nature, the will and deſire of the ſpeakers, who love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in the lye for it ſelfe, but as they thinke it fitte to further ſome good end; and becauſe their end is not at all to hurt, nor principally to deceive, but to profit or delight their neighbours: Even as contrariwiſe the guilt of pernicious lies is much aggravated, becauſe they are moſt oppoſite to Truth, and thoſe that tell them doe it willingly with love and delight: And finally, becauſe their chiefe aime and end is to deceive, and by deceite to hurt and wrong their neighbours in their goods or good name, life or liberty. But though ſome lyes are lighter and of leſſe guilt than others, yet all in ſome degree are ſinnefull and unlawfull, as being forbidden in the ninth Commandement. For whereas ſome object that they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by this precept, becauſe it onely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſuch untruths as are againſt our neighbour,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17130:42"/> whereas officious and merry lyes are not againſt, but for him, and for his good, even for his profit and delight; and offend not againſt charity, which is the ſumme of the Law. To this I anſwere, that all untruth is forbidden in this Commandement, whether it be for or againſt our neighbour; neither doth the Hebrew word <hi>Beth</hi> uſed here ſignifie only againſt, but alſo toward, or concerning, about or touching our neighbour: neither is <hi>hurt</hi> onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, but alſo any falſhood and untruth by any meanes ſignified of, unto, or concerning our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; for the word which is tranſlated bearing witneſſe, as if it were Legally, and before a Judge, ſignifieth in the originall, <hi>thou ſhalt not anſwere,</hi> which is as much in the Hebrew phraſe as thou ſhalt not ſay or cauſe to be ſaid, as appeareth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 15. 1. Matth. 11. 25. b Joh. 1. 7.</note> places. And the word <hi>witneſſe,</hi> ſignifieth any manner of ſhewing any thing, and ſo it is taken in other Scriptures. So that the ſenſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 15.</note> extends further than the words out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly portend: Neither doth it onely forbid all falſe, but alſo all vaine and idle ſpeech, as merry lyes for the moſt part are; nor yet only lyes which are againſt our neighbour, but alſo ſuch as are for him, either for his delight as merry lyes, or for his profit and advantage, as thoſe lyes which wee call officious. And therefore, ſeeing all lyes are the tranſgreſſion of the Law, it followeth by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohns</hi> definition that they are ſinnes; yea ſeeing every lye is a ſinne againſt a precept of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, it followeth that even by the opinion of the Schoolemen themſelves, who otherwiſe ſo much extenuate officious and merry lyes, they are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17130:43"/> mortall ſinnes, ſeeing veniall ſinnes (as they call them) are not committed <hi>Contra praecepta decalogi, ſed praeter ea;</hi> not againſt the Commandements, but beſides them. Againe, it is a ſinne againſt nature to lye in any kinde; becauſe words naturally are the ſignes and ſignifications of thoſe things which are in the minde; and therefore it is againſt nature to ſpeake or ſignifie any way that which the minde thinketh not. Finally in every lye though never ſo pleaſant or profitable, there is a loſſe of Truth, which is a vertue moſt acceptable unto God, and therefore the impeachment of it cannot be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced by our profit or delight.</p>
               <p>But let us more particularly examine theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>That merry Lyes are ſinfull and unlawfull.</hi>
                  </note> ſorts of lyes, and conſider how and in what meaſure and degree they are ſinfull and unlawfull. And firſt for pernicious lyes, there is no queſtion made by any, but that they are in a high degree ſinfull, as being againſt Trueth, Juſtice and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and wholly tend to Gods diſhonor, the hurt of our neighbors, and our own deſtruction and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as I ſhall more fully ſhew hereafter. And therefore paſſing them over I will examine the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds. And firſt for merry lyes, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly conceived, that if there bee no ſcurrility in them, they may paſſe as tolerable, becauſe they doe no hurt unto our ſelves or neighbours, but delight and recreate both; and they that tell them intend not to deceive their hearers; or but a while, that they may the more delight them. For either they are apparant in themſelves to be but jeſts and lyes by the groſſe abſurdities that are ſeene at the firſt view, or are diſcoverd to be ſo by the geſture and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17130:43"/> pronunciation. So that they are not much unlike unto Hyperboles or Ironies in reſpect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme and ſhew, ſaving that they differ in their end and uſe: ſeeing they are uſed to teach and expreſſe the Trueth in a Rhetoricall manner, but theſe onely to delight the hearer. And of this minde Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſeemeth to have beene, <note place="margin">Contra menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentium. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> who thinketh that they can ſcarcely bee taken for lyes. Jeſts therefore (ſaith hee) are to be excepted which were never thought to be lyes, becauſe they have a moſt evident ſignification, by the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, or the diſpoſition of him that thus jeſteth; and procede from a minde not willing to deceive, although it uttereth not truthes. And ſurely there is ſaith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> but a litle of a lye in theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tales, ſeeing though they willingly ſpeake that which is not true, yet the falſity is eaſily diſcerned and cannot deceive the hearer. But whether theſe merry tales or lyes ought to bee uſed by perfect men or ſtrict Chriſtians, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> doubteth in <note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> that place, though he cleareth it in another, where he ſaith, that hee lyeth, who hath one thing in his minde, and uttereth another thing by his words or any other ſignification; the which the merry lyar alwayes doth. And though hee doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or hurt, this doth not cleare his tales from being lyes, but onely ſheweth that they are not lyes of the worſt kinde, or ſuch as are pernicious, ſeeing he lyeth who doth ſpeake willingly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he thinketh. And as he ſpeaketh in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Contra men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium ad Conſentium. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> place, Thoſe lyes are not to bee admitted, which although they doe not hurt another, yet they doe not profit any, and doe hurt themſelves

For there is this difference betweene one that telleth a lye and a lyar. For he telleth a lye who lyeth unwillingly; but a lyar loveth to lye, and hath a minde that delighteth in lying. And though ſuch lyes hurt not the hearer, yet they greatly hurt the lyars themſelves, becauſe in ſo lying they forſake the truth and delight in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and chooſe rather to pleaſe men than to ſpeake the Truth. Againe theſe merry lyes are not onely in their falſity oppoſite to Trueth, but are alſo vaine and idle ſpeeches; and our Saviour telleth us, that <hi>Wee must give an account at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every idle word.</hi> Yea <hi>Epaminondas</hi> though an Heathen, ſhall at this day riſe up in judgement againſt merry lyars, who was ſo ſtrict and ſevere in embracing Trueth, that hee would not allow a lye to bee ſpoken ſo much as by way of jeſt.

For if (as wee ought to bee) wee were ſpiritually minded, why ſhould wee rather take pleaſure to heare or ſpeake lyes, than to ſpeake and heare the Trueth?

               <p>Secondly, it may bee demanded whether it bee <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>Whether of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious Lyes bee unlawfull.</hi>
                  </note> altogether unlawfull to tell officious lyes, ſeeing theſe in divers reſpects may ſeeme both juſtifiable and commendable; for he that telleth them hath no will ſimply to lye, but to doe good, nor deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in lying, but only as it conduceth to this end; neither hath hee any deſire to deceive or hurt his neighbour, but mainly aimeth at this end, that hee may benefit him by delivering him from ſome dangers, or free him from ſome great evill, which hee is not able to effect by any other meanes. To which I anſwere, that if it be a ſinne to lye, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſhewed and ſhall more fully proove hereafter) becauſe it is oppoſite to truth, a vertue which is in high eſteeme with the God of Truth, and a direct breach of his Commandement, then it is unlawfull to lye out of a deſire to produce the greateſt good. For every ſinne is an offence againſt Gods infinite Majeſty, and therefore deſerveth an infinite and endleſſe puniſhment both in ſoule and <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> body; from which we cannot be freed by all Men and Angels, ſeeing nothing can ſatisfie Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice for it, but a price of an infinite value, which no finite creature could pay, but onely the <hi>LORD</hi> JESUS CHRIST, God and Man, whoſe death and ſufferings were an All-ſufficient price for our redemption, in reſpect of the Dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that thus ſuffered. Againe, if it bee a ſinne to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17130:45"/> lye, then we ought not voluntary to commit it for the effecting of the greateſt good, ſeeing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us, that wee may not doe evill that <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> good may come thereof. And they alſo teach us that all lyes without exception or diſtinction are odious and abominable unto God, and that hee will <hi>destroy them that ſpeake leaſings.</hi> And what good <note place="margin">Prov. 12. 22. &amp; 6. 17, 19.

Finally, when wee lye out of hope to effect thereby any good, the ſinne committed is our owne, but the iſſue and effect is not in our power; for iſſues and future events are onely in Gods hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee doe not know whether upon the ſinne committed the good will follow; yea rather wee have juſt cauſe to feare the contrary: for how can wee expect Gods bleſſing upon the uſe of the meanes which hee hath curſed? Eſpecially ſeeing in truſting unto our owne ſinnefull inventions, we diſtruſt his Power and Providence, as though he were not ſufficient without the helpe of our lye to effect our good ends and deſires, in freeing any from imminent evills, or preſerving them in the moſt deſperate dangers.</p>

Firſt, it may be demanded whether it may not bee lawfull to tell a lye, when therein wee propound unto our ſelves ſome ſpeciall good end; as either the obtaining of ſome great benefit, or the avoyding of ſome great and imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into ſome evill of ſinne or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Concerning the former, I anſwere, that there can accrew unto us no ſuch benefit by lying, as is ſufficient to counterpoiſe the loſſe, to wit, of our ſoules by ſinning, if God in mercy ſhould not give us repentance. Secondly, that is not to bee eſteemed a benefit which is procured by unjuſtice; for even the Heathen man could teach us, that <note place="margin">Nihil utile quod non ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtum. <hi>Cic. offic.</hi>
                  </note> there is nothing profitable which is not honeſt, as no lye is, ſeeing truth is oppoſed by it. And the doctrine of Chriſtian religion informeth us in this truth, that it is not ſufficient for the making of an action good and lawfull that our end bee good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe alſo the meanes be ſo, by uſing whereof wee attaine unto this end. Thirdly, if this were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that wee might doe a leſſe evill for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17130:46"/> of a greater good; then as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

For then it might be lawfull for a theefe to rob a rich covetous man, that hordeth up his wealth and doth no good with it; if he propound this end to his theft, that hee will beſtow the greateſt part of what he hath ſtollen for the reliefe of the poore, or for a man to beare falſe witneſſe before a Judge, if it tend to the clearing of the innocent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of the nocent party; or to burne a Will or Teſtament when the Teſtator hath made choice of a bad Heire, and to ſubſtitute a falſe Will in the place thereof, that the inheritance or goods may not come to the hands of ſuch as will do noe good, but may by this meanes fall unto them who will feede the hungry, cloath the naked, lodge ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, redeeme captives, and build Churches, Why ſhould not all theſe evills bee done for theſe ends that be ſo good, if for theſe good things they ceaſe to be evill?

               <p>Concerning the latter, it may bee queſtioned <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>Whether it be lawfull to lye to prevent a greater ſinne in others.</hi>
                  </note> whether it bee lawfull to lye which is a leſſe evill, to avoide a greater evill either of ſinne or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Concerning ſinne we may conſider it either in another or in our ſelves. In another it may bee demanded whether we may not commit this ſmall
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17130:46"/> ſinne of an officious lye, to pull one or many of our neighbours out of a great ſinne, in which if they live and dye, there were no hope for them to eſcape damnation. As when wee ſee men to live in ſome damnable hereſie, the which they keepe ſo ſecret that there is no meanes to diſcover them to the Magiſtrate that they may be examined, confuted and reformed, unleſſe ſome orthodoxe Chriſtian by telling a lye, whereby he faineth himſelfe to be of the ſame opinions, doe dive into their ſecrets, and come acquainted with the moſt of them that are of this hereticall ſociety, that ſo afterwards he may lay them open unto thoſe that are beſt able to reclaime them. And this was the caſe of <hi>Conſentius,</hi> dealing with thoſe cunning heretiques called the Priſcillianiſtes, which occaſioned Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to write thoſe two books of this argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee commendeth <hi>Conſentius</hi> his love of truth, zeale, learning and elocution, but withall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his opinion and practice. For to ſay nothing of that ill companion which accompanieth this kinde of lying, which is treachery joyned with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, a vice odious in the eyes of all that are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ingenuous, and to conſider of the lye uſed to the former good end, what charity will teach a man to fall into one ſinne, that hee may pull his neighbour out of another, or to offend God our ſelves that wee may keepe others from offending him, or to endanger our owne ſoules that wee may deliver theirs out of danger? For true charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth at home, and teacheth us to love our neighbour as, and not better than our ſelves; and to love them in the ſame quality and trueth of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17130:47"/> affection, and not in the ſame quantity and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea if we ſhould take this courſe to reclaime Heretikes, wee ſhould love our ſelves leſſe than them; becauſe in ſome reſpects we commit a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinne than they, ſeeing they maintaine their errours out of ignorance, but we lye againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience, as hee alſo ſpeaketh.

                  </note> ſinne in others; yet perhaps it may be lawfull, yea commendable to uſe it, when wee may thereby prevent greater ſinnes not onely in others, but alſo in our ſelves. As ſuppoſe that a vertuous Matrone or chaſte Virgine ſhould be aſſaulted by an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with violence to defile or deflowre them, and they might eſcape the rape, by putting him off with a lye, is it not lawfull to doe it in ſuch a caſe to prevent ſo great a miſchiefe? I anſwere, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17130:47"/> though a ſtony heart could not chuſe but relent and be much affected to heare of ſuch a villany, and though the tentation be ſo ſtrong that it is ſcarſely to be expected, humane ſtrength ſhould be able to reſiſt it, yet in clearing of the truth wee muſt not conſider what we would, but what we ſhould doe being ſo aſſaulted and brought into ſuch ſtraites. Indeede if it were a ſinne to bee meere patients in the ſinne of others, the queſtion were eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; but it is not ſo, for the greateſt ſinne in others is not the leaſt ſinne in us, if wee onely bee the ſubjects of their ſinne, through unreſiſtable vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and doe not give the leaſt conſent unto it. For here it is all one as in the caſe of perſecution, oppreſſion, murther or robbery, all which though they be hainous ſinnes in the agents, yet none at all in the patients, when they have no will to conſent or allow the commiſſion of ſuch ſinnes, nor power to prevent or ſhun them. Yea in ſuch caſes that is lawfully ſuffered, which cannot but unlawfully be avoided; and no act is to bee judged ſinfull if the will bee wholly averſe unto it. For it is the very forme that giveth unto ſinne its life and being, to be in ſome kinde or degree voluntary, and though the will give not its conſent in all ſinnes, yet it hath ſome kinde of operation in or about it, as in ſinnes of ignorance, though wee doe not conſent unto ſinne as knowing it to bee ſo, yet wee conſent to that action which is ſinfull, the will being miſled through the errour of our judgement. And ſo in concupiſcence which goeth before conſent, there is that which we call ineſcation, or the bayting of the hooke of ſinne with ſome pleaſure, profit or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17130:48"/> other allurement, which is Sathans tentation, and not imputed unto us as ſinne if we wholly reſiſt it; and there is that which we call titillation or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and revolving of the tentation with ſome delight, and (as it were) the itching of the deſire and the watring of the teeth after it, if wee might injoy it upon no hard conditions. But when they are ſo propounded, as that wee cannot injoy the pleaſure or profit of ſin, unleſſe we diſpleaſe God, and indanger our owne ſoules, then the will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the tentation, and will by no meanes give its conſent. Notwithſtanding, that retaining of the tentation with ſome tickling delight, is a ſinne of concupiſcence, and this very parlying with the Divell is a tranſgreſſion of Gods Law, though wee doe not yeeld up unto him the Fort of our hearts, nor give our conſent that ſin ſhall enter. Of which ſinne the will is guilty, which though it did not conſent to the Act, yet it gave way to the Divels diſpute, and that with ſome tickling delight wee ſhould liſten to his tentation alluring us to ſinne. But if as in this caſe of a violent rape the will bee wholly averſe unto it, and the heart abhor it, even as the terrours of death; though the agent and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſher committeth an horrible ſinne, yet the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or party forced and raviſhed is wholly cleare of it. For the body onely is violated, but the ſoule not vitiated, and though that bee defiled, yet it is not corrupted, or at leaſt with ſuch a corruption that is not ſinful; as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaketh. For there is onely the matter of ſin which giveth it no being in a ſubject forced by outward violence; but not the forme, which giveth onely being and denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17130:48"/> ſeeing the will is wholly averſe unto it. So that if this bee granted which cannot bee denied, that it is a ſinne to lye, but no ſin to be forced and raviſhed, then the caſe is eaſily cleared, namely that it is not lawfull by the evill of ſinne, to ſhun ſuch an evill as is not ſinfull; actively to defile the ſoule that the body may not paſſively be defiled; or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hope that wee may ſhun the outrage of the adulterous raviſher, to caſt our ſelves certainely into the ſnares of the Divell by lying and ſinning, and ſo to be defiled by ſpirituall filthineſſe; and to be deflowred and deprived inwardly in our ſoules of their purity and chaſtity. And of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who ſpeaketh excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Nulla eſt pudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citia corporis, niſi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

There is (ſaith hee) no chaſtity of the body which doth not depend upon the integrity of the minde, which being pulled from the other, it muſt needs fall, although it may ſeeme untainted and untouched, and for this cauſe is not to bee numbred amongſt temporall things, ſeeing they may be taken from thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave them. And therefore by no means the minde muſt corrupt it ſelfe with a lye for its body, which it knoweth to remaine incorrupt, if the incorruption doth not depart from the ſoule. For what the body ſuffreth through violence, there being no precedent luſt, it is rather to bee reputed vexation than corruption. Or if every ſuch vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee corruption, yet every corruption is not then diſhoneſt, but onely that which luſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, or unto which luſt hath conſented.

And becauſe it were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to ſtand upon all the particulars, I will inſiſt onely in one, which will cleare the queſtion in all the reſt, as being the greateſt and laſt of all the reſt, namely Death, which is the king of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and therefore to be avoyded by all lawfull <note place="margin">Job 18. 14.</note> meanes above all other temporary evills. And this we will conſider either as it reſpecteth our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or our ſelves. Concerning the former, we will conſider the caſe in two inſtances propounded by Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and not much vary from him in our anſwere and reſolution. Suppoſe that a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his deere and onely Son were at the ſame time dangerouſly ſicke in ſeverall places or rooms, and that the Son (in whoſe life the life of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is bound up, as it is ſaid of <hi>Iacobs</hi> in <hi>Benjamins)</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:17130:49"/> ſhould dye the Father continuing in great weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet in ſome hope of recovery. If the Father in this caſe ſhould inquire (ſuſpecting the worſt) whether his Sonne be dead or alive, what anſwere ſhould be given him? If it be ſaid that he is alive, it is a lye, but yet ſuch an one as comforteth and ſtrengtheneth the Fathers heart, and may prove a good meanes of his recovery; but if it bee told him that he is dead, (or which is all one in effect, if the hearers refuſe to give any anſwere, becauſe he will ſurely preſume upon their ſilence that hee is departed, ſeeing otherwiſe they would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold newes which would cheare him) the griefe hereof will preſently ſtrike him to the heart, and bee a certaine cauſe of his death and ruine. But I anſwer with him, that though the caſe be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and much commiſeration to bee had of the ſicke Father, yet it is not lawfull to ſave his life by telling a lye. For this is but a meanes of our owne for his recovery, and wee know not whether God will bleſſe it or no, yea we may well ſuſpect, that if we diſtruſt in his All-ſufficiency, who hath in his hand the iſſues of life and death, and is able to bring to the grave, and to returne backe againe, and truſt more to our lye and meanes unlawfull, it will prove rather a hindrance than a furtherance to our deſires. Whereas on the other ſide we are certaine that lying is a ſinne, and that all ſinne will ſlay our ſoules, if the wound be not recured by repentance, which wee cannot promiſe unto our ſelves, ſeeing it is not in our owne power, but the gift of God which hee giveth when and to whom he pleaſeth. Finally, if it bee lawfull by ſinning to prevent the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17130:50"/> death of another, the death of their body which is temporall, with the death of our ſoule which is eternall; why might it not bee lawfull alſo much more, if an adultereſſe ſhould ſo deſperately love us, that if ſhe might not have her luſt ſatisfied, ſhee would hang or drowne her ſelfe, to prevent her death by yeelding to her deſire, ſeeing by one act of uncleanneſſe wee ſhould prevent her murther, and by prolonging her life procure time for her repentance, that ſhee may bee ſaved; whereas by the other courſe ſhee not repenting plungeth her ſelfe into Hell. The other inſtance is this; If an <note place="margin">Auguſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra mendacium ad Conſentium <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> innocent religious man ſhould be purſued by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous ruffians, or bloody perſecutors, with a full intention to deprive him of his life, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting whereof hee is forced to flye from them, or to hide himſelfe in ſome ſecret place, with which his flight or place of hiding we onely are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The queſtion is if the purſuers aske us which way he is gone, or if hee be hidden with us or no, whether we may not by an officious ly preſerve his life, directing them to take a wrong way in their purſuit, that ſo he may eſcape, or telling them that he is gone from us and not in our houſe; ſeeing if we ſpeake the truth, we ſhall thereby expoſe him to certaine danger of death, and if we refuſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we ſhall not onely be indangered to taſte of their rage, but alſo doe no good to the party, whom we have received and hidden, ſeeing upon our ſilence they will certainly preſume, that hee is hidden with us, or elſe we would make no ſcruple to deny it. To which I anſwere with Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> that wee muſt not lye, and ſo by ſinning
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17130:50"/> offend Gods infinite Majeſty, and indanger the eternall ſalvation of our ſoules, in hope to preſerve the momentary life of anothers body. What then? muſt wee tell the truth and ſo betray his life into their hands that ſeeke it? No by no meanes, for this is much worſe than the other. Muſt we then ſay nothing, when as ſilence is no leſſe dangerous then ſpeaking the truth? Nor this neither, ſeeing this as little conduceth to our end of preſerving our neighbours life, as if wee confeſſed the truth. What then muſt bee done? ſurely (as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> alſo reſolveth it) we are in ſuch a caſe called by God to put on Chriſtian courage and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to endure any extremities, rather than we will either betray the truth or the innocent man, who hath intruſted his life to our ſecrecy. And therefore wee ought boldly to profeſſe, that wee know what is become of the party whom they purſue, but will not by telling them expoſe him to the danger of their cruelty, becauſe we will neither betray him, nor offend God by telling a lye. And of this Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> bringeth an example of a Biſhop, called <hi>Firmus,</hi> whom he commendeth to have beene more firme in his will and reſolution, than in his name: who when he had with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence hid a perſecuted Chriſtian from the rage of an heathen Emperor, and being by his Purſevants which hee had ſent to apprehend him, demanded where they might finde him, couragiouſly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, that he could neither lye, nor betray the man; for which though they put him to many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet hee remained conſtant in his reſolution. Who afterwards being brought to the Emperor,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17130:51"/> ſeemed unto him ſo admirable in his faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, that without any difficulty hee obtayned pardon for him whom he had hidden.</p>
               <p>The other part of the queſtion concerneth our <note place="margin">§ 6. <hi>Whether we may lawfully lye to ſave our owne lives.</hi>
                  </note> ſelves, namely whether wee ought for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our owne lives tell a lye, when as all other meanes are wanting, and this onely promiſeth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Unto which a ſhort anſwere may ſuffice, if we conſider what hath beene already ſaid in the former caſes; for it is a ſin to lye, but no ſinne to dye; and our life is not ſo much worth, that wee ſhould ſpinne out the thread thereof to a further length with wicked hands, nor buy it at ſo deare a rate as the price of ſin, which is an offence againſt Gods infinite Majeſty, and therefore of infinite guilt; from the condemnation whereof wee could not be redeemed at any lower price, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious death and blood ſhed of the Eternall Sonne of God. Againe, by voluntary ſinning we expoſe our ſoules to death everlaſting, and at the moſt by not ſinning and lying we indanger but our bodies to a temporall death, which either ſooner may bee brought by ſome unexpected ſickneſſe, or by nature it ſelfe a little later; ſo that in effect long life is but the addition, and untimely death but the ſubſtraction of a few dayes or yeeres. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as much as the ſoule is to be preferred before the body, and life Eternall before this life of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, with ſo much more care and circumſpection, wee muſt ſhun lying more than dying, ſeeing by that the loſſe of our chiefeſt jewell is indangered, and by this wee have no great loſſe. Excellently Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> to this purpoſe: who (ſaith hee) <note place="margin">Quis obſervat vanitatem? qui timendo mori menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; timendo enim morimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur &amp; moritur antequam mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatur, qui idcò mentiebatur ut vivcret, &amp;c. <hi>In Pſal.</hi> 30.</note>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:17130:51"/> obſerveth vanity? Hee that lyeth fearing to dye. For fearing to dye hee lyeth, and ſo dyeth before he ſhould dye, who therefore lyeth that he might live. Thou wilt lye leſt thou ſhouldeſt dye, and ſo lyeſt and dyeſt. And when thou ſhunneſt one death which thou canſt onely put off, but not eſcape, thou falleſt into two, firſt dying in thy ſoule, and afterwards in body, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is ſo farre of from being lawfull to lye <note place="margin">§. 7. <hi>That wee may not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lye to advance Gods glory.</hi>
                  </note> officiouſly in the behalfe of men, that it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe it for the advancement of Gods glory; for though he requireth that we ſhould propound it as the maine end of all our actions, according to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>Whether you eate, drinke, or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>whatſoever you doe, doe all to the glory of God:</hi> yet hee will not have us onely to ſeeke his Glory in reſpect of the end, but alſo in regard of all lawfull meanes which conduce to the furthering of this end; and being the God of Truth, hee eſteemeth himſelfe more diſhonoured than <hi>glorified</hi> by our lye, though our chiefe end and aime therein be to advance his Glory. For as one ſaith well: It is no leſſe evill <note place="margin">Pet. Mart. <hi>in</hi> 2 Sam. 9. 8.</note> to ſpeake falſe things to Gods prayſe, than not to beleeve of him thoſe that are true. And therefore <hi>Iob</hi> reprooveth his friendes for thoſe untruthes, which they ſpoke againſt him; though their maine end was to Juſtifie God, and to Glorifie him in his Juſtice. <hi>Will you</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſpeake wickedly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Job. 13. 7. 8, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>for God, and talke deceitfully for Him? Will yee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his Perſon? Will yee contend for God? Hee will ſurely reprove you, if yee doe ſecretly accept perſons.</hi> So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> though for the glory of Chriſt, and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 15.</note> God his Father, he had teſtified that he had raiſed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17130:52"/> him up from the dead, yet hee acknowledgeth that hee ſhould deſervedly bee eſteemed no better than a falſe witneſſe of God, if Chriſt indeede were not yet riſen. So that we muſt not lye though our end bee that God thereby may have Glory, ſeeing hee needeth not our lye, being able to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himſelfe by us, when wee uſe lawfull meanes to lawfull endes. In which reſpect I have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much miſliked thoſe fained miracles recorded in ſome Eccleſiaſticall Stories, wrought upon ſleight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and to as little end, purpoſely (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) deviſed by the Authors to glorifie Chriſt, and propagate the Goſpell; and much more the lying miracles and minte of untruthes invented and ſtamped by the Pope and his Emiſſaries in their Legends, to worke as they pretend an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſteeme of the Chriſtian Truth in the hearts of the people, though they grace them with the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> Pious deceits: ſeeing they <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 9.</note> not onely uſe lying meanes, but alſo aime at wicked ends; not to confirme and grace the truth, but to ſeduce the people, and leade them into errors.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus have I fully prooved that <note place="margin">§. 1. <hi>The obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lyes are not againſt charity anſwered.</hi>
                  </note> no lyes though never ſo officious to God or men, may bee lawfully uſed; the which being clearely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and well weighed, it will bee eaſie to anſwere all objections which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made by the Authors of them; whether they be grounded on ſeeming reaſons, or on the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the faithfull who have ſometimes uſed them. Concerning the former; It is firſt objected, that theſe officious lyes are lawfull, becauſe they are not againſt charity which is the end and ſumme of the Law; but they advance our neighbours good, at which we ſhould aime in all our words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and doe not offend againſt humane ſocieties, but rather preſerve them, ſeeing thereby men are kept ſafe and freed from dangers. So the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>the end of the Commandement is Charity:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 5. Rom. 13. 8. Matth. 22. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>and hee that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law.</hi> I anſwere, If wee take Charity in a generall ſenſe, it is the ſumme of the whole Law, as our Saviour maketh it, and includeth both all duties towards God required in the firſt Table, and towards our neighbours commanded in the ſecond; in both which we are injoyned that our love ſhould bee in truth. For firſt, God requireth that wee ſhould <note place="margin">John 4. 24. Pſal. 51. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> and in all his Service
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17130:53"/> Hee requireth <hi>Truth in the inward partes,</hi> without <note place="margin">Pſal. 17. 1. Jer. 3. 10. Eſay. 29. 13.</note> which all religious duties are odious unto him; for hee abhorreth ſuch prayers as are made with fained lippes; and if there be a diſtance betweene our tongues and our hearts when wee draw nigh unto him, our prayers will be rejected and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. So alſo our love towards our neighbours, muſt bee joyned with Truth; for <hi>Charity rejoyceth in the Truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth us, even as <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note> the Truth rejoyceth in Charity, and therefore as we muſt <hi>ſpeake the Truth in Love,</hi> ſo wee muſt love in the Truth, ſeeing neither are ſincere and right, if either of them be divided from the other. And if our Charity bee racked by importunity of our neighbours to ſpeake a lye in their behalfe, wee muſt ſay with the Apoſtle, that <hi>wee can doe nothing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi> For though carnall love may thus ſtretch it ſelfe beyond the bounds of Truth and Juſtice, yet Chriſtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will never goe alone, but delights in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe and all other vertues. And even the Heathen themſelves, who had no other guide but the light of nature, limitted their love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with their Piety and Truth; and therefore, though they would goe farre with their friends in the way of amity, yet no further than would ſtand with Piety; to which that proverbe tended, <hi>uſque</hi>

                  </note> Truth is a greater friend than both. And the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaith, that it is a pious thing even among friends, to honor and eſteeme highly of the Truth,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17130:53"/> beſides Chriſtian charity requireth not that wee ſhould hurt our ſelves to helpe another, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our owne ſoules, by wilfull ſinning, that wee may preſerve our neighbours body or ſtate from deſtruction. For it is ſaid, <hi>that the Lord will destroy</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is objected that it is a good and <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>The obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of doing good by lyes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
                  </note> commendable thing to doe good, to preſerve life, and deliver from danger; but this is done by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious lye. I anſwere, it is good and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe good by good and lawfull meanes, and to compaſſe our laudable ends by ſuch meanes as are lawfull and commendable; but it is not ſo, if we uſe ſinnefull meanes, though our ends be never ſo excellent; for <hi>wee may not doe any evill, that good</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>may come thereof.</hi> Now lyes in all kindes are evill, becauſe they are contrary to the truth, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Gods Law, as before I have ſhewed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any lye (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith) to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <note place="margin">Enchirid. ad Laurentium. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</note> no ſinne, becauſe by lying wee may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times profit another; for ſo wee may doe alſo by ſtealing, if a poore man to whom what wee ſteale is openly given, doe feele the profit of it, and the rich man from whom wee ſecretly take it doe not feele the diſprofit of it. And yet for all this no man will ſay that theft is no ſinne. Yea ſo we may profit by committing adultery; if a woman out of deſperate luſt will dye unleſſe wee conſent unto her, ſeeing though ſhe have played the harlot, yet if ſhee live, ſhee may repent of it; and yet no man will ſay that we doe not ſinne if wee commit upon theſe tearmes ſuch an act of filthineſſe. Now if Chaſtity doth deſervedly ſo much pleaſe us,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17130:54"/> wherein I pray you hath truth offended us, that we may not for another mans profit violate that by committing adultery, and yet may violate this by telling of lyes?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is objected, that an officious lye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not under the definition of a lye, ſeeing he <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>The obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious lye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not under the definition of a lye, anſwered.</hi>
                  </note> that uſeth it hath no love to lying nor delight in it, neither is it his minde or deſire to deceive or hurt, but to doe good and benefit his neighbour. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that it is a lye to ſpeake an untruth contrary to that which we know and conceive in our mind, whether we love and will it with delight, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and loath it; or whether it deceiue and hurt our neighbour, or delight and benefit him. For though we doe not abſolutely will it, yet wee doe conditionally and accidentally, that we may attain unto our end. And though wee doe not deceive our neighbour to the hurt of his perſon, or the hinderance of his eſtate, yet wee deceive him by miſleading his minde and miſinforming his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cauſing him to fall into errour, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace falſehood in the ſtead of truth. Beſides truth it ſelfe is violated, whilſt it is diſ-throned, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth which is oppoſite unto it, is ſet up in its place. But hereby wee doe moſt of all deceive and hurt our ſelves, whileſt by ſinning to benefit our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his corporall and temporall eſtate, wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger our ſoules to everlaſting perdition. And whereas it may be objected, that it is no ſinne nor breach of Gods Law, which onely forbiddeth ſuch untruths as are againſt, &amp; not for the good of our neighbours: to this I have before fully anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and therefore need not here to inſiſt further on it.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:17130:54"/>
               <p> Finally, it is objected that wee have many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken from examples of the faithfull in the Scriptures, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
                  </note> of the faithfull in the Scriptures, who upon ſeverall occaſions have uſed officious lyes to free themſelves and others out of great and imminent dangers. To which I firſt generally anſwere, that theſe examples are recorded, but not approoved, or if in ſome reſpects allowed or commended, yet not for their lyes, but for their love of juſtice and mercy, their aime at Gods glory or their owne and others good; their pious affections to vertue and goodneſſe, and their readineſſe to advance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and honeſt actions. Neither are their lyes propounded as patternes and precedents for our imitation, but as examples of humane frailty, that they may ſerve as Sea markes to make us ſhunne theſe rockes, when by like tempeſts of tentation we are in danger to fall upon them. For howſoever they were Gods great worthies, and had attained to a great meaſure of grace and goodnes, yet they were but in part ſanctified, having ſtill infirmities and corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in part remaining in them, as it were little ſpots and blemiſhes in beautifull bodies. And therefore wee muſt live, not by examples, but by precepts, or at leaſt imitate them only ſo far as they follow the rule of Gods word, and make them our patternes in their vertuous actions, and not in their frailties and aberrations; according to that of the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> Apoſtle; <hi>be ye followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us deſcend to ſome particulars. And firſt <note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of</hi> Abraham, <hi>objected.</hi>
                  </note> the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> is objected, who called <hi>Sarah</hi> his ſiſter to preſerve his life from danger. But I have ſhewed before that this was <hi>Abrahams</hi> infirmity through feare of death, and wee muſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17130:55"/> follow <hi>Abrahams</hi> example in his faith, and not in his frailties and failings. Againe, the example of <hi>Abraham</hi> is objected ſaying to his yong men: <hi>Abide you here with the Aſſe, and I and the lad will goe yonder</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and worſhip, and come againe to you,</hi> whereas it was his reſolution to ſacrifice his ſonne. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Prophet, and might ſpeake this as a Propheticall prediction, not directed with his owne reaſon, but by the inſtinct and motion of the Spirit, who knew what would be the iſſue of his action: or he might ſpeake this out of the confidence of his faith, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading himſelfe that though he ſacrificed and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſon, yet God was able to reſtore him againe to life, and would aſſuredly doe it as being both gracious, and alſo true in that ſpeciall promiſe, that he would give him <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and that <hi>in his ſeede all the Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> And to this I rather incline, becauſe I have my warrant from the words of the Apoſtle, who ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 17, 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>by faith when he was tried offered up Iſaac, and hee that had received the promiſe offered up his onely begotten ſonne, of whom it was ſaid, that in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede be called: accounting that God was able to raiſe him up even from the dead, from whence alſo he received him in a figure.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the example of the Egyptian mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Midwives objected and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
                  </note> is objected, who by an officious ly preſerved the yong children of the Iſraelites from that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſlaughter intended and commanded by <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> To which I anſwere, firſt, that it doth not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeare that they lyed, and where things or ſpeeches are doubtfull, charity will have us to take
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17130:55"/> them in the beſt ſenſe. It may bee that the Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh women having ſpeciall ſtrength and aſſiſtance from God, that they might eſcape the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane decree, concerning the death of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were delivered in their travell before the Midwives comming, having alſo ſome helpe one of another; a thing to bee beleeved without any great difficulty by the Iriſh-women, and thoſe that converſe with them and know their manners, who have experience of their eaſie labour, quicke diſpatch, and ſpeedy recovery. And it is likely that in their caſe they would put themſelves to the uttermoſt of their ſtrength, though it were with ſome danger, to preſerve their Children. Neither is it improbable that the Egyptian Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives out of their mercifull diſpoſition, faith and feare of God, did them all the favour that they could, by giving them ſecret notice of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that they might have time to prevent the miſchiefe by hiding their Children, and when they came, by making a ſleight or no ſearch. But though it were granted that they lyed in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yet this will prove nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are no precedents or patternes for us to immitate in their lying, ſeeing they might doe it through feare and infirmity. And whereas it may bee objected that their faith is commended and their worke rewarded by God; for it is ſaid, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 20. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>God dealt well with the Midwives, becauſe they feared God</hi> more than the King, <hi>and built them houſes.</hi> To this I anſwere, that their mercy, faith, and feare of God was acceptable, approved and rewarded, but not their lye; and therefore graciouſly looking
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17130:56"/> upon the better part rather than the worſe, God pardoned and paſſed by their infirmity and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in his grace and mercy rewarded their faith and obedience. Even as hee is ſaid to have approved and proſpered divers of the good Kings of Judah, becauſe their hearts were upright in the maine points and parts of his Service, though they tooke not away the high places; not becauſe hee approoved their want of zeale, in purging the Church throughly from ſuperſtition, but becauſe delighting in their integrity hee paſſed by, and pardoned their failings and infirmities.</p>
               <p>Much like unto this is the example of <hi>Rahab,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 7. <hi>The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of</hi> Rahab <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi>
                  </note> hiding the Iſraelitiſh ſpies, and telling her Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens that they were departed. The which ſome would charitably excuſe, as though it were no lye, becauſe keping an Inne, ſome other of her gueſts might depart in the Evening, of whom ſhe might truly ſay, that they were gone. And I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be as charitable as they, if there were any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of truth. But it is not likely that the Citizens in ſuch a weighty buſineſſe, would make ſuch a ſleight inquiry, but that ſhee might eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand after whom they inquired. Yea, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that ſhee knew thoſe whom ſhee had hid were the Men, or elſe to what purpoſe did ſhee hide them? And therefore, for her to ſay that they were departed, not meaning them after whom they inquired, but ſome other who in her owne knowledge were not the Men; what was it, but to equivocate and lye, ſeeing ſhee ſpoke not as the thing was, nor in that ſenſe as they asked, nor yet as ſhe deſired that they ſhould underſtand her;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17130:56"/> and that to this purpoſe, that ſhee might deceive and delude them. But what of all this? Is <hi>Rahabs</hi> example a priviledge againſt plaine precepts, and a fit patterne for us to immitate, who lately was an Harlot, an Innekeeper, having ſmall knowledge as yet of Gods Will, and now but a new convert, under a ſtrong tentation, and in a great conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene feare and faith? Yea, but the Apoſtle <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 31.</note> commendeth her faith in this act, by which ſhee was preſerved from periſhing with the reſt. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that ſhee was ſaved by her faith, and not by her lye; and becauſe beleeving Gods wonders done for the Iſraelites, and his Word revealed and expounded unto her by her Gueſts, ſhee had received them, concealed, diſmiſſed them, and preſerved their lives, with the hazzard of her owne; and not becauſe ſhee had in the manner of doing it, followed her owne device, which feare and not faith ſuggeſted, ſeeing ſhee had no warrant for it, out of GODS Word.</p>

To which I anſwere, that when wee are to deale with God, and to humble our ſoules before him in the unfained acknowledgement of our ſinnes and wants, imperfections and corruptions, it may bee lawfull and profitable to aggravate them even with hyperbolicall expreſſions, out of a godly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of our ſelves, becauſe our <hi>hearts are ſo wicked</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17130:57"/> adultery, drunkenneſſe and the like, of which our conſciences in the ſight of God doe cleare and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit us; becauſe hereby we give glory unto God, magnifying his mercy and bounty, who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given unto us ſuch great debts, and becauſe we doe alſo exerciſe our repentance and increaſe our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for ſinne and worke our hearts to a true hatred of it; according to that of the Prophet: <hi>Then ſhall</hi>

                  <hi>ye remember your owne evill wayes and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your owne ſight for your iniquities and abominations.</hi> But when wee have to deale with men, wee muſt ſpeake the truth, as we in our underſtanding conceive of it, as well of our ſelves, as of other men; and though we ought for the moſt part modeſtly to conceale thoſe things which concerne our owne prayſes, and may to the full lay open our wants and infirmities when juſt occaſion ſhall bee offered; yet when wee are neceſſarily put to ſpeake of either, we muſt not out of a ſinnefull modeſty lye and betray the truth, but ingenuouſly ſpeake what wee truely conceive, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denying or too much extenuating Gods gifts and graces in us, nor accuſing our ſelves of thoſe ſinnes, imperfections and corruptions of which we know that wee are as cleare as other of Gods ſervants; yea if we be unjuſtly ſuſpected and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them, we are bound in conſcience to excuſe and defend our ſelves and to manifeſt what we can our owne innocency. For firſt Gods Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that wee ſhould give a true teſtimony of our ſelves, as well as of others, and uſe all good means to preſerve our owne fame and good name, as well as our neighbours. Secondly, by denying Gods
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17130:58"/> gifts and graces in us, wee ungratefully diſhonour him, not acknowledging his bounty and goodnes towards us, and refuſing to aſcribe unto him the Glory of theſe gifts whereof hee is the Author. Thirdly, we put out theſe lights which were given <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note> us to this end, that ſhining before men, they might take occaſion thereby to glorifie our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fourthly, wee wrong our neighbours by working in their mindes a falſe opinion, and by cauſing them unjuſtly to ſleight and diſeſteeme us, when as they thinke that our gifts and good parts are much leſſer, and our faults and ſinnes far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than in truth they are; ſeeing men for the moſt part ſpeake of themſelves, rather better than worſe than they deſerve. And ſecondly, whileſt wee ſuppreſſe, deny or extenuate our vertues, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate our failings and corruptions, wee neglect this Chriſtian duty of edifying one another by our good example, and contrariwiſe make our ſelves ſcandalous and offenſive. And finally, wee wrong our owne perſons; for if it bee an injury to belye another, it is no leſſe if we belye our ſelves; and if it bee an unjuſt and uncharitable act to robbe our neighbors of their good name, by falſe extenuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the good things which are in them, or aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of their faults and faylings, how can it bee leſſe ſinnefull if wee uſe the ſame meanes to ſpoile our ſelves of this precious jewell? To this purpoſe (though in another caſe) Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſpeaketh for confuting the Pelagians, and Coeleſtianians, who affirmed that they were pure and free from ſin, and yet for humility ſake againſt their conſcience and perſwaſion confeſſed their
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17130:58"/> ſinnes, of which they thought themſelves pure and cleare, hee thus convinceth them of their errour: Doſt thou (ſaith he) lye for humility? Thou art juſt and without ſinne; but for humilities ſake thou <note place="margin">Propter humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem ergo mentiris? &amp;c. <hi>Auguſt. de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Apoſtoli.

Thou art juſt, thou art without ſinne, and yet thou ſayeſt that thou haſt ſinne: therefore thou art a falſe witneſſe againſt thy ſelfe, God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of thy lying humility; examine thy life, and looke into thy conſcience, &amp;c. How ſhall I take thee for a witneſſe in another mans cauſe, who ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in thine owne? Thou makeſt Saints guilty, whileſt thou beareſt againſt thy ſelfe a falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, what wilt thou doe to another who ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt thy ſelfe? I demand; art thou juſt or a ſinner? thou anſwereſt a ſinner. Thou lyeſt, becauſe thou doeſt not ſay that with thy mouth, which thou beleeveſt of thy ſelfe in thy heart. And therefore, though thou wilt not be a ſinner before, now thou beginneſt to bee ſince thou lyeſt. For thou ſayeſt for humilities ſake that thou calleſt thy ſelfe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp;c. But can there be humility where there is falſity.</p>
               <p>But againſt this is objected, that we have many <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of</hi> Agur <hi>in defence of modeſt lyes, objected and anſwered.</hi>
                  </note> examples of holy men in the Scriptures, that in modeſty and humility have abaſed themſelves in the acknowledgement of their wants, infirmities, and ſinnes, beyond all boundes of Truth; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome whereof wee can take no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeeing they were Pen-men of the Scriptures, and immediately inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt. <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:17130:59"/> The firſt is of <hi>Agur,</hi> who being a Prophet of great wiſedome and underſtanding, thus abaſeth and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifieth himſelfe: <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>man, and have not the understanding of a man. I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned wiſedome, nor have the knowledge of the Holy.</hi> I anſwere, that we muſt not underſtand theſe wordes ſimply and abſolutely, but reſpectively. Firſt, in reſpect of the Perſon to whom he ſpeaketh and in whoſe preſence hee ſtandeth, to wit, <hi>Ithiel,</hi> which ſignifieth the ſtrong God with us, and <hi>Veal,</hi> ſignifying one who having all power in his hand, is able to doe whatſoever he will. By both which he underſtandeth our Lord JESUS CHRIST, the Wiſedome and Power of his FATHER, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of whom the wiſeſt in the world are bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh and deſtitute of knowledge. Secondly he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this acknowledgement in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter which he was to ſpeake of, namely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly Wiſedome, which as much tranſcended his reach and capacity, as reaſon in man excelleth brutiſh ſenſe; according to that of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderfull for me;</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> Thirdly, hee ſpeaketh not ſimply but reſpectively, comparing the little which hee knew, with the much which hee knew not; like that of <hi>Socrates, hoc unum ſcio, me nihil ſcire;</hi> I onely know this, that I know nothing. Fourthly, hee may bee ſaid thus to ſpeake, not as hee was now ſanctified and inlightned with the ſpirit of Grace and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but as he was in the ſtate of nature, in which reſpect the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Every man is brutiſh in</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the example of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of</hi> Paul, <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 9. Eph. 3. 8. 1 Tim. 1. 15. 2 Cor. 11. 5. 1 Cor. 15. 10. Phil. 3. 5. Act. 26. 5.</note> objected, who ſaith that he was the <hi>leaſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and not worthy to be called on Apostle,</hi> yea that he was <hi>the leaſt of all the Saints;</hi> yea which is more, <hi>that he was the chiefe of ſinners;</hi> whereas elſewhere hee maketh himſelfe equall to the chiefe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſuperiour unto them all in his labours and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and as touching the Law a Phariſee, yea in reſpect of his life and converſation of the ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteſt of that Sect. From whence they conclude, that in thoſe ſpeeches wherein hee ſo much abaſed himſelfe he uſed a modeſt lye, and therefore that modeſt lyes are in ſuch caſes lawfull. To which I anſwere, that hee called himſelfe the leaſt of the Apoſtles, and the leaſt of the Saints, not ſimply and generally, but reſpectively, as hee expreſſeth himſelfe, <hi>becauſe he had perſecuted the Church of God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 9. 1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> In which regard alſo he calleth himſelfe the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of ſinners, as it is evident in the ſame places. But how can this bee other than a modeſt lye, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould call himſelfe the chiefeſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſeeing others committed farre greater ſinnes than hee, and yet upon their repentance were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy, as <hi>Manaſſes?</hi> Some underſtand
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17130:60"/> the words, that hee was the firſt of ſinners (as the word may alſo ſignifie) namely the firſt of all thoſe that came unto Chriſt, who had before perſecuted him in his members. But this had beene no great aggravation of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſinne, nor amplification of Gods mercy in pardoning it, both which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle intendeth in that place. And therefore I had rather take it in a litterall ſenſe, namely that in truth hee calleth himſelfe the greateſt ſinner that had received mercy. Firſt becauſe hee ſpeaketh as hee thinketh, and findeth himſelfe in his owne ſenſe and feeling: for as it is the nature of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie to make our owne beames moates, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers moates beames; ſo it is the nature of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to aggravate our owne ſinnes, and to extenuate other mens: and when the eyes of our mindes are inlightned, wee ſee our ſinnes to bee more in number, and more haynous in quality, either in themſelves, or in reſpect of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than wee can charitably ſuſpect to bee in any other of Gods ſervants. Secondly, becauſe hee ſpeaketh in my judgement as the thing is. For if wee limitte his ſpeech to the faithfull onely, who upon their repentance, have beene received to grace; (as wee muſt needs doe, ſeeing ſome have lived and died in their infidelity and finall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, and others have committed the ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, with whom there is no probability that the Apoſtle compared himſelfe) I ſay, reſtraining the compariſon onely to penitent ſinners, then it is true which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, that of all ſinners he was the chiefe; whether wee conſider the ſinne it ſelfe, or as it was aggravated
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17130:60"/> by circumſtances. For he madly and maliciouſly perſecuted the Saints of God, for their profeſſion of Chriſt and the Goſpell; and not being content <note place="margin">Act. 26. 11.</note> to blaſpheme his holy Name himſelfe, hee doth as much as in him lyeth, compell them alſo to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheeme, as hee confeſſeth, and ſo lacked nothing but this of committing the unpardonable ſinne, that he <hi>did it ignorantly,</hi> as himſelfe acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> Beſides hee had great and many meanes of knowledge and of revealing unto him Chriſt and the Light of the Goſpell, and ſome of them hee careleſly neglected, and ſome he utterly deſpiſed. Of the former ſort was the Law of God, in which having great skill, he might in the ceremonies and ſacrifices have ſeene Chriſt crucified before his eyes, by which, through the blindeneſſe of his minde, and hardneſſe of his heart, hee profitted not. Of the latter was the Heavenly and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sermons of our Saviour himſelfe, and of his Apoſtles, which were confirmed by many and wonderfull miracles, all which he deſpiſed; either not vouchſafing to heare them, or not receiving or beleeving them; ſo that nothing could touch his heart hardened in his ſinne: And whereas ſome had ſinned out of ſimple errour and ignorance, and had proceeded in their ſinne, even to the crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord of Life, yet afterwards when by the Preaching of the Apoſtles, they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their ſinne, they repented of it and beleeved in Chriſt; hee ſtill proceedeth in his madneſſe and fury to perſecute the Saints of God, not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe to heare that they were murthered and maſſacred, unleſſe he ſtood by and ſatiated his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17130:61"/> eyes with their death and ſlaughter. Yea ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate he was in his ſinne and rebellion, that either he muſt periſh in it, or God muſt pull him out of it by ſtrong hand, and uſe a miracle upon him for his converſion. By all which it appeareth that S. <hi>Paul</hi> had no neede to uſe the helpe of a modeſt lye, when he called himſelfe the chiefeſt of ſinners.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is objected, that our Saviour Chriſt <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
                  </note> himſelfe, who was greater than all the Angels, as being the Eternall Sonne of God, equall with his Father, the Prince of Angels, and as hee was our Mediator God and Man; yet in that Propheticall Pſalme of his Paſſion and Sufferings, hee that was God maketh himſelfe leſſe than a man; <hi>But I</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>am a worme and no man.</hi> The which is to bee underſtood not onely of <hi>David</hi> the Type, but alſo, and that chiefly of Chriſt himſelfe the Antitype, in whoſe Perſon the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh. To which I anſwere, that our Saviour ſpeaketh this not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but reſpectively; not what he abſolutely was, nor what he was in his owne nature, or in his ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, but what he was reputed to be in the ſight and opinion of the people; who looking upon him as a Man forſaken of God, and expoſed to the malice of his enemies, and <hi>being astonied at him, his viſage was ſo marred</hi> with his ſufferings <hi>more than any</hi>

                  <p>Of the meanes to diſſwade us from Lying, and firſt, becauſe it is an hainous ſinne.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſpoken of the divers ſorts of lyes, <note place="margin">§. 1. <hi>That Lying is an hainous ſin, proved by the Scriptures.</hi>
                  </note> and proved that they are all ſinnefull and unlawfull: It now followeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order which I firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, that I ſet downe the meanes whereby we may be preſerved from this ſinne. The which are of two ſorts; the firſt is to ſhew the dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deſperateneſſe of this diſeaſe of lying, that ſo wee may with more earneſtneſſe deſire to be cured; and then the remedies which may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cure. For ſo much doe men ſleight this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17130:62"/> ſickeneſſe of the ſoule, as though there were no danger in it; yea ſo farre are the moſt in love with it, ſo loath to leave it, and ſo willing to live and die in this diſeaſe, which in their carnall reaſon they finde ſo pleaſant and profitable, that in this, if in any other, the queſtion of our Saviour may be well propounded to our ſicke and impotent Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; <hi>wilt thou bee made whole?</hi> For as thoſe that <note place="margin">John 5. 6.</note> are ſicke of a Lethargy delight in ſleeping, though it will bring aſſured death, and being rouzed out of it by their friends, are much diſpleaſed with them, becauſe they are diſturbed and diſquieted: ſo is it with the moſt men in this caſe, apprehending no danger, and ſenſually feeling delight in this ſickeneſſe, they love their diſeaſe and loath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. That men therefore may not ſecurely ſleepe in this ſinne of Lying, as apprehending no danger, I will firſt ſhew the greatneſſe and hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it in the ſight of God and all good men; that ſo all may be brought into a hatred and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of it, and then preſcribe ſome means which may ſtrengthen us againſt it. Concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, though lying were but a ſmall ſin in it ſelfe, yet it were not ſmall unto us, if wee allow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, love and delight in it, ſeeing it is joyned with preſumption and impenitency; neither (as one ſaith) is there any ſinne ſo veniall, which is not <note place="margin">Auguſtine</note> made criminall, whilſt it pleaſeth and delighteth: But it is not ſo in Gods ſight, how lightly ſoever men eſteeme of it, as will eaſily appeare by the following diſcourſe. For the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſetting downe a Catalogue of moſt hainous ſinners, as prophane perſons, parricides, murtherers, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:17130:62"/> Sodomites, men-ſtealers and perjur'd perſons, doth ranke lyars in the reare of them; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> numbereth them with dogs, ſorcerers, <note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 15.</note> whore-mongers and idolaters, all which ſhall bee excluded out of the gates of the Heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. And the Holy Ghoſt in the Hebrew tongue calleth a lye <hi>Aven,</hi> which alſo ſignifieth iniquity; implying that all lyes are iniquity, and that all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is after a ſort included in a lye, ſeeing every ſinne is in this reſpect a lye, as it is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth of God which forbiddeth it. And <note place="margin">A lyer worſe than a theefe.</note> howſoever men meaſuring the guilt of ſinnes by their profit and diſprofit, doe hang up theeves, and oftentimes laugh at lyars, yea even reward them if they be skilfull in their Art: yet is lying in it owne nature worſe than theeving, and a common lyar, than a common theefe; according to that of the ſonne of <hi>Syrach: A theefe is better than a man which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccli. 20. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>is accustomed to lye, and they both ſhall have destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to heritage.</hi> For theft is committed immediately againſt men, but a lye againſt God, the God of Truth, and is therefore aggravated as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt a much more excellent Object. Theft ſpoyleth us of our worldly goods, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our eſtates, but lying exceedeth theft in theft, robbing us of a much more excellent jewell, even ſpirituall truth, which is the riches and ornament of the mind. Yea it depriveth both the liar and him that hearkneth unto lies of eternall ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing in this reſpect the theefe only hurteth himſelfe, but cannot hinder him from the fruition of bleſſednes whom he robbeth, though he taketh from him his earthly riches. Againe, the Law of God appointed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17130:63"/> that the theefe ſhould make ſatisfaction to him whom hee had wronged, by reſtoring unto him ſowre or five fold, and ſo by recompence made the fault in reſpect of men curable; but no ſatisfaction is appointed to bee made unto thoſe who are wronged by lying, there being for it no valuable recompence, ſeeing they are robbed of a Jewell <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 23.</note> above all price. Finally, lying is worſe than ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as being the cauſe of it, and the chiefe incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement which ſetteth the theefe on worke to commit his ſinne: for if men were reſolved to ſpeake nothing but truth, they would never ſteale, ſeeing when they are examined, they muſt confeſſe their offence, and receive deſerved puniſhment; but becauſe they hope to eſcape by hiding their ſinne with lyes, therefore they are imboldned to the committing of it. And yet I have ſaid nothing of the malignity of this ſinne and ſickeneſſe of the ſoule, more than is in theft, whereby it becommeth more contagious, infecting others with its poyſon; for whereas in ſtealing the theefe himſelfe onely ſinneth, and not he that is robbed by him; in lying not onely they ſinne who tell the lyes, but all they likewiſe who delight to heare them, and are too credulous in beleeving of them.</p>
               <p>Yea not onely the Scriptures, but even the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then writers, Poets and Philoſophers, by the light <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>Lying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a great ſinne even by the Heathens</hi>
                  </note> of nature have in all ages condemned lying as an hainous and hatefull vice. Many of whoſe ſayings <hi>Stobaeus</hi> recordeth to this purpoſe: One ſaith that he is unhappy, who rather uſes lies though ſeemingly <note place="margin">Euripides.</note> good, than truthes when hee judgeth them evill. And againe; certainly it is a thing intolerable to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17130:63"/> tell lyes. Another telleth us, that he is equally his enemy as the gates of Hell, who conceaveth one thing in his minde, and ſpeaketh another thing with his mouth. And that <hi>Iupiter</hi> the great father <note place="margin">

Another perſwadeth thus; tell (ſaith hee) no lyes; but ſpeake all truthes: And againe, doe not hide one thing in thy heart, and utter another with thy tongue. Another affirmeth, that every prudent <note place="margin">Cleobulus.</note> and wiſe man hateth a lye. And the Philoſopher <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> (as before was ſhewed) deriveth the Greeke word ſignifying a lye, from another which ſignifieth a thing diſhoneſt and worthy reprehenſion, becauſe every lye is of this nature. Finally, <hi>Plato</hi> in many <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> places condemneth lies and pleadeth for the truth. To thinke the truth (ſaith he) is honeſt, but a filthy and diſhoneſt thing to lye: And againe, a lye is odious not onely to the gods, but alſo to men. And therefore if the Heathens could diſcover the fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deformities of this vice by the dimme light of nature; what a ſhame is it for us to bee ſo blinde in our underſtandings and ignorant, as not to diſcerne the uglineſſe of it, when as we have the cleare ſun-ſhine of the Goſpell, and the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Holy Spirit to guide and direct us.</p>
               <p>But let us come more particularly to ſhew the <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>That Lying is oppoſite to Gods nature.</hi>
                  </note> haynouſneſſe of this vice, which will better bee cleared if we prove that it hath in it all relations of ſinne, as it is committed either againſt God, our neighbours, or our ſelves; and is not onely a ſinne in it ſelfe, but alſo the cauſe and the effect of many other evills, both of ſinne and puniſhment, as it will appeare if wee examine ſome particulars. For
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17130:64"/> firſt, lying is in this reſpect a great ſinne, becauſe it is contrary to God the chiefe goodneſſe, whether we conſider his Nature or his Perſons. In his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eſſence he is in and of himſelfe, and the fountaine of Being; and in this ſenſe it is moſt true that being, Truth, and Goodneſſe, are convertible and all one: He is not only True but Truth it ſelfe, and all other things are true in and for him. And thus he deſcribeth himſelfe; <hi>Mercifull, Gracious,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Long-ſuffering, and aboundant in Goodneſſe and Truth.</hi> So <hi>Moſes</hi> in his ſong: <hi>He is a God of Truth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Eſay 65. 16.</note> yea hee is ſo eſſentially True, as that there is none true beſides him; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let GOD be True, but every man a lyar;</hi> and though <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> it be at mans choyce to ſpeake the truth or to lye, yet truth being of Gods Eſſence, and the Truth of God, nothing but the True God, hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God can no more deny the Truth, than deny Himſelfe. And therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould lye,</hi> yea though he can doe <note place="margin">Numb. 23. 19.</note> all things, yet <hi>He cannot lye;</hi> yea that <hi>it is impoſsible</hi>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17130:65"/> a lye, which oppoſeth it, is a great ſinne and moſt odious unto him, ſeeing it oppoſeth himſelfe and his owne nature, who is a God of Truth; for hee who lyeth, denieth the Truth; and he who denieth it, denieth God himſelfe. Again, Truth which hath its exiſtence in the minde againſt which the lyar ſpeaketh, is of the Spirit of God, who is the Author of all Truth, and therefore what is it to lye, but to make the tongue ſpeake againſt the Truth ingraven in the minde by the Spirit, and conſequently to ſpeake againſt the Holy Spirit himſelfe who is the <note place="margin">Lev. 6. 2.</note> Author of it?</p>

Finally we ſinne immediately againſt God by ſuppreſſing truth and telling lyes; becauſe thereby we hinder and impeach his Glory, whileſt we hide our vices and faults from comming to light, and ſtoppe the courſe of Juſtice when it ſhould deſervedly proceede againſt us, to inflict upon us deſerved puniſhment, in the execution whereof, Gods glory is advanced, as <hi>Ioſuah</hi> impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his ſpeech to <hi>Achan; My ſonne, I pray thee</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17130:68"/> how much more hurtfull is it to have theſe blemiſhes in our ſoules and to have Gods image defaced in us?

And this wee ſee in the example of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, unto whom Sathan lyeth even againſt God himſelfe, and alſo teacheth them to lye; from whom this corruption and diſpoſition of Lying is propagated to all their poſterity; in the example of the foure hundred falſe Prophets in whoſe mouth Sathan was a lying ſpirit teaching them to lye perniciouſly to <hi>Ahabs</hi> deſtruction, as himſelfe confeſſeth; and of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Whoſe hearts</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Nahum. 3. 1.</note> And as Lying is the Cauſe and Effect of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes, ſo it is the meanes to make us lye and dye in them without repentance: for whereas there is no other meanes to bring us to the ſight of our ſinnes and unfeined ſorrow for it, nor to worke in us reformation for the time to come, but the carefull and conſcionable hearing of Gods Word, and Law, which convinceth us of our wickedneſſe and ſheweth our miſerable condition whileſt wee continue in it, Lying doth ſtop our eares, that we will not liſten unto it, nor beeleve it; as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet implyeth in thoſe words, <hi>This is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not heare the</hi>

Yea, he will be ready to lye when hee never thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it; and as the skilfull Muſition, who hath brought his hand by much practice to an habite, will play his leſſon when his minde is on ſome other matter; ſo when by cuſtome men are come to an habite of lying, they will lye at unawares, and if they bee challenged for it, they are ready to lye againe by denying that they lyed. In reſpect of which habite and cuſtome, Saint <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, that a lyar will continue to lye even after death. He that lyeth (ſaith he) being not deceived by the ſeduction of the Divell, but willingly and of ſet purpoſe, will never leave to lye, no not after death, for death ſeparateth the ſoule from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but doth not change the purpoſe of lying: wilt thou know this? conſider thoſe lyars even after death. <hi>Lord in thy name we</hi> have done this and that. Did not they know in themſelves, that they never loved Chriſt, nor did his Will? yes, but they thinke that as in this world they have deceived men, ſo alſo there that they can deceive even God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and therefore hee doth not ſay; depart from me ye that have wrought iniquity, but ye that now worke it: becauſe wicked men ceaſe not to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, no not after death; ſeeing though they cannot now ſin, yet they retain ſtill their purpoſe of ſining.</p>

Although I thinke that our great gallants doe not take the word ſo much to heart, becauſe their truth is queſtioned and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached (for then they would hate the vice it ſelfe as much as the name) as becauſe it toucheth them in their valour and courage, ſeeing lying is a baſe and cowardly vice, into which men oftentimes fall out of meere feare, and becauſe they dare not ſpeake or ſtand to the truth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this vice of lying maketh us odious <note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>That lyes make men odious unto God and men.</hi>

And who would not love that which God loveth? and embrace and delight in that, in which God delighteth and will reward? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it maketh lyars odious unto men; as being a diſhoneſt and diſhonourable vice, reprehended and condemned of all as unworthy an ingenuous civill man, and much more a Chriſtian, who profeſſeth himſelfe a ſervant and childe of the God of Truth. But eſpecially, it is hurtfull to thoſe that feare God and love his truth, and maketh thoſe that make and love lyes odious in their eyes, according to that of the wiſe <hi>Salomon: A righteous man hateth lying, but</hi>

                  <hi>but thy Law doe I love.</hi> Yea hee maketh this a note and ſigne of a bleſſed man, that hee diſ-reſpecteth lyars: <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that reſpecteth not</hi>

                  <hi>the proud, nor ſuch as turne aſide to lyes.</hi> But though lyars are chiefly odious in their eyes, yet not in theirs onely; for even ingenuous men, though meerely civill, doe abhorre lyars as they are perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17130:73"/> members of a State, and bring with them much miſchiefe, both to the whole Common-wealth, and alſo to private families and particular perſons: yea oftentimes they that make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lying for advantage, do yet hate it in others when unpartially they looke upon it, and doe not behold it through the ſpectacles of ſelfe-love, and even they that like and love it in themſelves, yet cannot indure that others ſhould uſe it. Yea ſo loathſome it is in its owne nature, if it be not ſugred and ſweetned with ſome profit or pleaſure, that though they uſe it, yet they are aſhamed to owne it, and can upon no tearmes indure to bee branded with the name, which they hold moſt odious and reproachfull, though they make no ſcruple (ſo it be unknowne) to be tainted and poyſoned with the vice. Finally, as lying maketh men odious both to the innocent and guilty, ſo it maketh the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent odious to the lyar, when as hee knoweth that he hath abuſed them with his untruthes, according to that Italian, or rather Machivellian proverbe, <hi>whom I have wronged, I will never forgive.</hi> And this diſpoſition the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> obſerveth to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious lyars and ſlanderers; <hi>A lying tongue</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">Prov. 26. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>hateth thoſe that are afflicted by it:</hi> Of which this may be the reaſon, becauſe they who have injured others by their lyes, doe expect from them juſt revenge, and upon due examination of their fault, that they will bring the truth to light, and them to ſuffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſhame and puniſhment. <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>That Lyes weaken faith and hope, diſpoile us of the girdle of verity, and a good conſcience.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, lyes are pernicious unto the lyars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in divers other reſpects; for firſt they wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their faith in the aſſurance of their ſalvation,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17130:73"/> yea deprive them of all hope of Heavenly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſeeing it is an infallible marke of one that ſhall dwell in this holy Hill, that <hi>hee ſpeaketh the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Truth in his heart.</hi> Now if we count that pernicious to our perſons and ſtate, that defaces our eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſome earthly Patrimony, and cuts off all our aſſurance ever to injoy it; how much more is that pernicious, that cuts off all our hopes to our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Inheritance, and deprives us of that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table note and ſigne, that wee have juſt title unto it? Secondly, it diſpoyles us of a chiefe part of our Chriſtian armour, the girdle of verity, wherewith <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 14.</note> all the reſt is buckled unto us, and ſo layeth us open and naked to all the aſſaults of Sathans ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to bee thereby foyled, overcome, and led captive of ſinne, when as he findeth us ſo diſarmed. Thirdly, becauſe it depriveth us of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when as wee make no ſcruple of ſuch a ſinne as is committed directly againſt it, yea it waſteth and woundeth a naturall conſcience, when as wee live in ſuch a vice as it condemneth. For if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be not ſear'd, it is ready as ſoone as a man hath lyed, to accuſe him of ſinne, and to teſtifie againſt him, that he hath offended God by denying truth, and done that which would be a ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto him if it ſhould come to light. And this is the cauſe why having lyed they are ſo loath to acknowledge it, but uſe all their Art and policy to hide and cover it, that ſo they may ſeeme not to have lyed: yea if they bee convinced or but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of it, they are ready to diſcover their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward guilt of conſcience by their outward bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the which is eſpecially to be obſerved in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17130:74"/> who are not by cuſtome hardned and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their ſinne; becauſe they even naturally knowing that lying is a fowle and diſhonourable vice, and that they have done evill in falling into it, as their conſciences are preſſed with the guilt of their ſinne, ſo their faces are filled with the ſhame that accompanies it.</p>
               <p>And thus lyars are pernicious unto themſelves, <note place="margin">§. 7. <hi>That lyes bring upon lyars the evill of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in this life.</hi>
                  </note> in reſpect of the evill of ſinne: Now further it commeth to bee conſidered how it bringeth upon them the evill of puniſhment. For howſoever it is made but a ſleight ſinne amongſt men, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly for the moſt part ſleightly puniſhed, yet it is haynous in Gods ſight, and puniſhed by him with great ſeverity. And though the lyar through his cunning skill can often ſo hide his lyes, that men cannot diſcover them, and ſo are freed from the puniſhment both of their fault and lye with which they cover it, yet Gods All-ſeeing eye can eaſily finde them out in all their ſubtilties and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning conveyances, and his mighty hand of Juſtice ſhall ſurely reach unto them, and inflict upon them <note place="margin">Prov. 19. 5.</note> deſerved puniſhments. So the wiſe man ſaith, that howſoever it may fare with others, yet <hi>he that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>lyes ſhall not eſcape.</hi> And though they delight to open their mouthes to lye for their advantage, yet God will ſtoppe them with his puniſhments, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh: upon which ground in another place by a Propheticall Spirit foreſeeing their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, he prayeth againſt them: <hi>for the ſinne of their mouth, and the words of their lippes, let them even</hi>

                  <hi>bee taken in their pride, and for their curſing and lying which they ſpeake.</hi> Neither will God lightly puniſh
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17130:74"/> thoſe who love and make lyes, but it cauſes him to have a controverſie with a land, to haſten his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to inflict ſuch heavy judgements, as will make the <hi>land to mourne, and every one that dwelleth therein to languiſh,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> threatneth. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4. 1. 2, 3.</note> For he will bring upon lyars utter deſtruction; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>Thou ſhalt deſtroy</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 12. 1.</note> And of this we have examples in the Scripture; as in <hi>Gehazi,</hi> whoſe lie was puniſhed with a perpetuall Leproſie, upon himſelfe and all his Poſterity: In <hi>Haman,</hi> who ſlandering <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the Jewes, and by his lyes plotting their ruine, was taken in his owne net, and both hee and his ſonnes hanged upon the ſame gallowes which hee had made for innocent <hi>Mordecai:</hi> And in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heſt. 3. 8. Act. 5. 2. 3.</note> who for their lye were puniſhed with preſent and ſudden death. And therefore as much as wee hate death and deſtruction, ſo much let us abhor lying, which is the cauſe thereof; and with as much care and endeavour let us ſhunne the one, as well as the other.</p>
               <p>And as God thus puniſheth lyes in this life; ſo <note place="margin">§. 8. <hi>That God puniſheth lyars with everlaſting condemnation</hi>
                  </note> much more fearefully in the life to come. For firſt it excludeth lyars out of the Kingdome of Heaven,

                  <hi>that hee knoweth God, and keepeth not his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements hee is a lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</hi> Yea they are ſuch contraries as have no meane, but the preſence of the one argueth the abſence of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17130:76"/> the other, and the ſame heart at the ſame time can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love and delight in both, but if it loveth and delighteth in lyes, it hateth and abhorreth the Truth. And therefore ſeeing Truth is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Vertue, and exceeding pleaſing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto God, as being like unto him in his owne Nature; It muſt needs follow by the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, that lying is a moſt baſe and diſhonourable vice, and moſt odious and abominable unto God, as being oppoſite to his owne Nature. Neither may wee qualifie and extenuate the ſinne by our diſtinction of merry, officious and pernicious lyes: for howſoever theſe ſeverall kindes may in other reſpects, bee much more hainous and wicked one than another, much more odious to God and men; and will condemne lyars to greater or leſſer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in Hell fire; yet all of them are alike odious and abominable in this, that they are all oppoſite to that excellent vertue of Truth, and in every kinde of them, contrary to Gods pure and perfect Nature, who is eſſentially true and Truth it ſelfe. In which regard even the beſt ſort of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lyes are evill and ſinfull, as namely when as men will tell them to confirme the Truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to perſwade men more ſtrongly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to imbrace, profeſſe and practice the true religion, by reporting fained miracles that have beene for merly wrought for the confirmation of this Truth, which, as alſo others of like nature, are called pious lyes. For firſt they are contrary to Truth, an excellent Vertue, and therefore muſt needes be vicious; they are oppoſite to Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and diſhonourable unto him, as though hee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17130:76"/> were not able to maintaine his Truth, unleſſe wee helped him with our lyes; neither do they ſo much grace and confirme the Truth of religion, when they are kept ſecret, as diſgrace and weaken it, when they are diſcovered and come to light: nor ſo much ſtrengthen mens faith in beleeving it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus countenanced with lying wonders; as weaken it when the deceit is knowne, ſeeing theſe pious and officious lyes will make men, when they are diſcerned jealous and ſuſpicious of reall truths, and take away from their teachers all power in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading, making their arguments and motives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to piety of no credit or efficacy; ſeeing they that are moved and perſwaded, are ready to ſuſpect that their ſpeeches are all alike; that ſeeing they have told them of falſe miracles, therefore there are none true, but all of one kinde, although ſome more than other, are more cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly acted; and that all the reaſons and motives which they uſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to a godly life, are nothing but officious lyes, which their teachers out of a pious affection and intention, uſe to countenance religion, and to make their exhortations and perſwaſions unto pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honeſty, more forcible and efficacious. And this was the reaſon which made Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtol.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17130:77"/> will eaſily ſurmiſe, that the things they heare and read are but pious and officious lyes, to bring into, and keepe men in the right way: and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have in them any reallity of Trueth. And therefore ſeeing theſe lyes are alſo unlawfull as being oppoſite to Truth; I conclude that there are not any lawfull, according to that of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi> There are (ſaith he) many kindes of lyes, <note place="margin">Mendaciorum genera multa ſunt quae qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem omnia uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaliter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And againe, thoſe things which are done againſt the Law of God cannot bee juſt, and <hi>David</hi> ſaith unto God, <hi>thy Law is Truth;</hi> ſo that <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> what is againſt Truth, cannot bee juſt, as all lyes are, &amp;c. And therefore when examples of lying are alleadged out of the Scriptures, either they are not lyes, but are onely thought ſo, becauſe they are not underſtood, or if they bee lyes, they may not be imitated, becauſe they are not juſt, as being againſt Truth.</p>
               <p>And this is the next motive to make us to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and forſake lyes, becauſe they are alſo oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>That lyes are oppoſite to Justice.</hi>

And therefore either injuſtice is ſometimes profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or elſe a lye is alwayes unprofitable: and hereof it is that the Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> joyneth theſe two together: <hi>The remnant of Iſrael ſhall not doe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>iniquity, nor ſpeake lyes, neither ſhall a deceitfull tongue bee found in their mouth.</hi> And ſo <hi>Malachie,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that Truth was in <hi>Levies</hi> mouth, denyeth alſo that there was iniquity found in it. <hi>The Law</hi>

                  <hi>of Truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lippes.</hi> And therefore as wee love Juſtice, ſo alſo we muſt love Truth; and if we would not bee accounted unjuſt and wicked, we muſt be carefull to hate and ſhunne lying.</p>
               <p>Finally, lying is contrary to Charity, which as <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>That lyes are oppoſite to Charity.</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 6.</note> the Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>delighteth and rejoyceth in the Truth:</hi> Now Charity is the fulfilling of the whole Law, and compriſeth in it all duties towards God, our neighbours and our ſelves: and therefore lying in this reſpect, as it oppoſeth Charity, tranſgreſſeth the whole Law of God; for firſt, it diſhonoureth
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17130:78"/> God, and robbeth him of his Glory, as in thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects formerly ſpoken of, namely becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods Nature and Truth, and tranſgreſſeth his Word and revealed Will; ſo alſo becauſe the Lyar, like the Divell, in a ſort blaſphemeth God in oppoſing his workes, taking upon him to give a being to that which is not, and to make ſomething of nothing, which is proper and peculiar to divine Omnipotency, which nevertheleſſe is but an apiſh imitation, and not done in Truth; for whereas God by his Almighty Power giveth a true being to things that are not, and maketh all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the Divell and thoſe his children that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him in lying, doe not by their words give a true being to things that are not, but onely labour to imitate God herein as much as they are able, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto them a falſe being in the opinions of thoſe whom they deceive with their lyes, and though they are not, yet make them ſeeme to bee in ſhew and appearance. Even as the Divell by his jugling trickes and impoſtures, caſteth falſe miſts before mens eyes, and maketh them beleeve that they ſee many things which they ſee not, and which in truth are not, whileſt being unable to give a true exiſtence to theſe things, he onely deludeth and abuſeth their phantaſie. Secondly, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to true Charity in reſpect of our neighbors, ſeeing it robbeth their mindes of that precious Jewell of Truth, and putteth in the place thereof (as it were) the baſe bugles and worthleſſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits of lyes, beſides all thoſe evills and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, of which I have formerly ſpoken. Finally, it is moſt contrary to that Charity and Love which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17130:78"/> every man oweth to himſelfe, ſeeing it bringeth upon a man innumerable evills, ſpoyling him of truth, and many other graces in this life, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving him of all hope to injoy eternall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or to eſcape the everlaſting torments of Hell fire in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Againe, (for a concluſion of this point) that we <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>That lying is but a vaine and ſleight vice.</hi>
                  </note> may be moved to loath lying, let us conſider, that as it is baſe and diſhonourable, ſo it is but a vaine and ſleight vice, which hath no ſolidity or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in it, and therefore laſteth and endureth not, but onely ſerveth for the preſent turne, to make a ſeeming and falſe ſhew, and then like a ſnuffe, the blaze going out, it endeth in ſtinke. It may ſeeme to bring profit for the time, and to make us rich like a Briſtoll Diamond or counterfeite Pearle, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſoft that it will not indure the hard touch of a wiſe tryall, it will ſoone looſe its gloſſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and make the owner if hee have given oughts for it, a looſer by his bargaine. It may like glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tinſell ſeeme for the time rich, and make a faire ſhew, and promiſe alſo to cover our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but even whileſt it ſeemeth outwardly to hide our ſinne and ſhame, we are inwardly in our hearts and conſciences never the warmer in reſpect of peace and ſound comfort; and within a while this baſe and ſleight ſtuffe will bee worne out to ragges, ſo that it will bee eaſie to ſee through it, and to diſcerne all that nakedneſſe and filthineſſe of vice and ſin, which at the firſt they promiſed to hide. To which purpoſe the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth excellently: <hi>The lippe of Truth ſhall be establiſhed</hi>

Hence it is that the Graecians call Truth by a name which ſignifieth ſuch a thing as cannot lie hid; but as the ſame Author ſpeaketh, though by the diſhoneſty of many it may bee depreſſed, yet it riſeth againe, and though the defence of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy may be checked and interrupted, yet in a while it will breath againe and get life. So <hi>Seneca</hi> (like himſelfe) ſpeaketh to this point wittily and fully. No diſſembling (ſaith he) profitteth, it deceiveth but a few, ſleightly drawing outwardly over it a falſe ſemblance. Truth is alwayes the ſame, and which way ſoever ye turne it, good on both ſides. Thoſe things that deceive, have in them nothing ſolid. A lye is ſo thinne a thing, that if thou doeſt diligently looke into it, thou mayeſt ſee through it.</p>
               <p>And yet (which may be another motive to make us hate lying) though it bee but a vaine and ſleight vice, and of ſhort durance; yet it is no eaſie thing, but requireth much labour. For it putteth the wit to its ſtrongeſt invention, and trieth to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the memory, and even tyreth it with much exerciſe; that the parts of their lyes may agree one with another, and when they are repeated, may ſeeme (like truth) to be alwayes the ſame: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if there be for want of wit or weakeneſſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:17130:79"/> the leaſt fayling, they are taken tripping and tardy in their tale, and ſometimes puniſhed both for their fault and falſehood, but alwayes at the leaſt ſhamed and diſgraced. In which regard when they have toyled themſelves in their uttermoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to hide their ſinne, yet are they alwayes upon the racke, and even when they are ſafe, they are not ſecure, but ſtill in feare leſt their lyes ſhall come to light; If at leaſt their impudence armed with power doe not incourage them to out-face the Truth, and reſtraine their inferiours to whom they lye, from preſſing them any further than will ſtand with their liking. An example whereof we have in <hi>Iacob,</hi> who intending to ſteale a bleſſing from his Father, doth uſe the uttermoſt of his wit and memory to interweave cunningly the webbe of his lyes, that he might not be diſcovered. And yet when he had improoved his lying Arts to the uttermoſt advantage, with what feare doe you thinke was he ſurpriſed? with what ſhaking hands and trembling voyce did he utter his lyes, whileſt he doubted, leſt his father diſcovering his fraude, hee might bring upon himſelfe a curſe in ſtead of a bleſſing. And therefore well might the Prophet ſpeake of Jeruſalem, that <hi>ſhee had wearied her ſelfe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 24. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>with lyes,</hi> and yet her <hi>great ſcumme,</hi> even her pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinnes and the guilt of them, was not gone out of her: for they that delight not to ſpeake the truth, but have taught their tongues to ſpeake lyes, doe (as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>weary themſelves to commit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>iniquitie.</hi> So that the Art of lying may well bee compared to the Spiders web, in weaving where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhee taketh great paines, yea ſpendeth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17130:80"/> out her owne bowels, though it ſerveth for no other uſe but to catch a few flies; and when all is done, ſhee cannot bee ſecure in her weake hold, but might juſtly feare (if ſhee had as much wit as a lyar) that ſhe ſhall bee beaten out of it with every blaſt of winde, or bruſh of a broome: whereas on the other ſide, the way of truth is ſo plaine and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that a weake memory, if we have once gone in it, will ſerve our turne to goe it againe; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as errour is manifold, it is ever one and the ſame, ſo that we may with confidence proceed in it, and not feare to bee tripped and catched, though wee are examined at ſeverall times and before divers perſons, becauſe if wee know the truth, and ſpeake nothing but what we know, the oftner we relate it the more we ſhall confirme it, ſeeing we ſhall ſtill ſpeake the ſame thing without varying in any matter of ſubſtance from that we have firſt ſpoken. And with this the judgement of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> accordeth: The fictions of a lye (ſaith he) are very <note place="margin">Difficillima &amp; laborioſa ſunt figmenta men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacii. Qui ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum vult dicere non laborat. &amp;c. <hi>Aug. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> 66.</note> difficult and laborious; whereas hee who deſireth to ſpeake the truth is at no great paines. For good men are farre quieter than thoſe that are evill, and the words of thoſe who ſpeake truth, are much more abſolute than the lyes of deceivers. And therefore if we would not take much pains to little purpoſe, and not with great danger goe the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way about, when wee may goe the next way with eaſe and ſafety; Let us not labour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe our endes by falſe ſleights, and lyes, which have alwayes in them more frothy ſubtilty, than ſubſtantiall ſolidity; but ſeeke to attaine unto them in the plaine and ſafe wayes of ſimplicity and truth.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17130:80"/> In which wayes if <hi>Iacob</hi> had walked, hee had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented many dangers, eſcaped many cares and toilſome labours under a churliſh uncle and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full maſter, and with much more ſpeed and ſafety had attained unto his end, and quietly enjoyed both birth-right and bleſſing.</p>

Now theſe meanes either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect meditation or affection and action. Firſt, if we would ſhun or leave Lying, we muſt often and ſeriouſly meditate on the manifold evils both of ſin and puniſhment before ſpoken of, as that it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable unto God and conſequently odious and hatefull to his pure and perfect Nature, moſt injurious to our neighbours and therefore abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all, and unto our ſelves moſt pernicious both in reſpect of our ſoules and bodies, in this life
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17130:81"/> and the life to come. For the reaſon why men are ſo apt to commit this ſin, is becauſe they ſo much ſlight it, as though it were no ſinne at all, or if it bee any, yet ſo ſmall and veniall, that it may well paſſe among humane frailties and infirmities; by which alſo wee have little dammage, ſeeing it is ſo common amongſt men, that the multitude of offenders taketh away the ſhame, and maketh it ſeeme to bee no ſinne; and on the other ſide brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it ſo much ſeeming profit and benefit, that it doth much overballance all the evils which doe accompany it. All which falſe conceits will eaſily vaniſh, if we throughly weigh and conſider the manifold and great evils of this ſinne which I have formerly diſcovered; and contrariwiſe the excellency of Trueth, and the innumerable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that it bringeth to thoſe who love and embrace it both in this world and the world to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us conſider that wee are alwayes <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>That wee conſider that we are alwaies in Gods ſight.</hi>

And therefore what will it advantage the Lyar, though hee can ſo cunningly coine his lyes that they will for a time goe currant amongſt men; if his Lord and Soveraigne diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth his falſity and treaſon? What if hee can

               <p>Thirdly, let us conſider that Trueth rather than <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>The third meanes is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that Truth is the beſt and readieſt way to attain our ends.</hi>
                  </note> lyes is a better and more likely meanes to attaine unto our ends, either of obtaining ſome benefit deſired, or of eſcaping ſome puniſhment feared. For the events and iſſues of all things are in Gods hand: hee it is that by his bleſſing conferreth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and in his juſt judgement inflicteth puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the hearts of all men are at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, either to like or diſlike us, to favour and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us for our good, or to bee the inſtruments of his juſtice to doe us hurt: For they are all but tooles in the hand of the great Worke-man, by whom he effecteth what hee will, according to his good pleaſure. Now then which is the likelier way for the compaſſing of our deſires, either in the obtaining of good or the avoiding of evill, to pleaſe God by ſpeaking Trueth, or to offend him by telling lyes, ſeeing all things are at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let us meditate and conſider that there will come a Day of Judgement when the ſecrets <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>The fourth meanes is to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

Now if it were a great ſhame to have all our lyes written in our foreheads, or if they bee not large enough, to have them publiſhed in the market place, and ſet up upon every poſte and pillar in the ſtreet; then what ſhame and confuſion ſhall cover their faces, when as they ſhall bee diſcovered at this dreadfull Day in the preſence of Men and Angels, and when as Sathan finding his marke and image upon Lyars ſhall owne them for his children, and carry them with him to inherit their patrimony in that Lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone?</p>
               <p>And theſe are the meanes which reſpect medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: <note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>Of the meanes which respect affection and action; firſt, that wee worke our hearts to a love of Truth.</hi>
                  </note> the meanes which reſpect affection and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are divers; the firſt is that we worke our hearts to the love of the Truth; by conſidering the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, excellency, profit and neceſſity of it; whereof it will come to paſſe that wee ſhall ſo eſteeme it that wee will purchaſe it at the deareſt prices, but not ſell it at any rate, according to that of the wiſe man, <hi>Buy the Trueth, but ſell it not.</hi> And if we love <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 23.</note> and highly eſteeme the Trueth, then will wee hate lyes as oppoſite unto it, and then will wee delight and rejoyce in it as in a precious jewell. But if we will not receive it with love and delight, God will leave us to the vanity of our mindes, the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vile affections, and unto ſtrong deluſions <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 11.</note> both to make, beleeve and delight in lyes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meanes is that wee ſet a carefull
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17130:82"/> watch over our lippes and tongue, that wee doe <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>The ſecond meanes is that we ſet a watch ouer our tongues.</hi>
                  </note> not ſpeake vainely, nor raſhly and unadviſedly. For commonly in many words there are ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueths, and they that are raſh in their words, ſpeake oftentimes they know not what, and for want of conſideration, at unawares ſpeake lyes in ſtead of Trueth, and having once ſpoken them, they will ſtand to what they have ſaid for their credits ſake, and to tell a ſecond lye to make the former ſeeme trueth. And therefore if we would avoid Lying, wee muſt with <hi>David, looke carefully to our wayes, and keepe our mouthes, as with a bridle,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>that we ſinne not with our tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third meanes is, That we mortifie our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">§. 7. <hi>The third meanes is that we mortifie our carnall luſts which are the cauſes of Lying.</hi>
                  </note> and worldly Luſts, which are the common Cauſes of Lying, as firſt and principally carnall and inordinate feare, whereby we feare men more than God, and ſo become more carefull to pleaſe them, that they may favour and reward us, and to avoid their anger and diſpleaſure that they may not hurt or puniſh us, than to pleaſe God or avoid his wrath who hath all power in his hand to reward or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us both in this life or the life to come. And this moveth men to tell Lyes, becauſe they looke onely to the preſent and not to eternity; and chuſe rather thereby to hazard their ſoules and bodies to everlaſting deſtruction, than to ſuffer temporary evils, or to endanger themſelves to preſent puniſhments. And therefore if we would avoid Lying, let us mortifie this carnall feare, and conſider for this end, how much more fearefull it is to fall into the hands of the everliving God, who is a conſuming Fire, than into the hands of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17130:83"/> mortall men, who when they have done their worſt, can but puniſh or kill the body, whereas he <note place="margin">Matth. 10. 28.</note> is able to caſt body and ſoule into hell, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaketh. Secondly, wee muſt if wee would avoid Lying, mortifie our carnall love of the world and earthly things, whereby wee are ordinarily tempted to the committing of this ſin. For who doth not ſee that they who ſet their hearts immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately on riches, are ready upon all occaſions to lye and deceive that they may get and encreaſe their wealth? and that they who dotingly affect honours, make no ſcruple to ſupplant others by their Lyes and machievellian policies and deceits that they may raiſe themſelves by their ruine.</p>
               <p>The fourth meanes is that we bee more carefull <note place="margin">§. 8. <hi>The fourth meanes is that we be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to flie ſinne than the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due unto it.</hi>
                  </note> to flie ſinne, than the puniſhment due unto it, and to avoid Lying than the evils of ſmart and ſhame that doe accompany it. For what is the reaſon which moveth men ſo often to fall into this ſin of Lying? but becauſe they make no conſcience of ſinne, and when they have committed it, and expect diſgrace or puniſhment, if it ſhould come to light, they uſe all their lying Arts to hide it, facing and out-facing the Trueth, that their faults may not be diſcovered, nor they puniſhed according to their demerits. Whereas if men ſhould labour in all things to keepe a good conſcience, they would not feare to have what they doe knowne unto any; and if they walked in the wayes of innocency, they would not feare to goe in the wayes of Trueth. And therefore if we would not lye, wee muſt carefully avoid the doing of any thing, which being done, if we be examined, we are not willing to confeſſe:
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17130:83"/> or if through frailty and infirmity we have failed in our duty, let us rather acknowledge our fault, than hide and excuſe it by a lye; and chuſe rather to undergoe the penalty and puniſhment, than to free our ſelves from it by committing ſinne. To which end let us conſider, that ſinne is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt evill, as being an offence againſt an infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Majeſtie, provoking an infinite wrath, and ſo deſerving as the due merit of it an infinite and everlaſting puniſhment. And therefore what is all the ſhame and puniſhment of this world unto which wee ſhall indanger our ſelves by acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging our faults, and confeſſing the Truth; in compariſon of Gods wrath, which is a conſuming fire, and which by lying wee kindle againſt us, and thoſe everlaſting Torments in the flames of Hell?</p>
               <p>The fifth meanes is to uſe all our lawfull indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <note place="margin">§. 9. <hi>The fifth meanes that we with all lawfull indeavour ſhun poverty.</hi>

For as the immoderate love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of riches and aboundance, is a ſtrong tentation to draw men to this ſinne of lying (as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) ſo the feare of want, and the ſenſe and ſmart of penury, is no leſſe potent and powerfull, to make them leave truth and to tell lyes, when they ſeeme helpefull for the bettering of their eſtate. And this wee finde by dayly experience; for who ſeeth not that lyes, (above all ſorts of men) are moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed among them that are of pooreſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17130:84"/> being neceſſitated hereunto by their pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wants and penury? And this the wiſe <hi>Agur</hi> well knew, who having intreated God <hi>to remove</hi>

In which reſpect thoſe that will avoide this ſinne of lying, muſt doe their beſt to preſerve themſelves from extreame poverty; and to this end uſe all good providence in getting and keeping a ſufficient competency of eſtate, and all induſtry, diligence and painefulneſſe in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their particular callings, craving Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon their labours, who onely giveth <hi>power to get riches;</hi> and <hi>except he build the houſe, they labour in</hi>

                  </note> aſſiſtance handled the pointes, which in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I propounded, and ſhewed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this vice, what it is, the cauſes and kindes of it, with the meanes whereby we may bee preſerved from this common infection, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red if we bee tainted with it; it now followeth in the laſt place, that I adde a word or two by way of uſe. And firſt, ſeeing Truth is ſuch an excellent Vertue and precious Jewell, let this move us high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to priſe and dearely love it, and following the wiſe mans counſell, <hi>let us buy it</hi> though it coſt us <note place="margin">Prov. 23. 23.</note> deare, but <hi>never ſell it</hi> at any rate. For though it may ſeeme at the firſt ſight that we have much da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and diſadvantage by it, and that by ſpeaking the ſimple truth wee make our ſelves a prey to the crafty, who have great helpe by their lyes to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent and deceive us; that wee have much loſſe in our trading and bargaining, buying and ſelling when wee are reſtrained in our liberty of lying, whileſt that others that make no conſcience of it, have many helpes and advantages thereby to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ends, and advance their gaine: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that wee ſhall by confeſſing the Truth, when we have offended, incurre much diſpleaſure, and expoſe our ſelves to the hard opinions of thoſe that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17130:85"/> are ſet over us, yea oftentimes to rigour and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; whereas others more faulty by the helpe of their Iyes doe frame ſuch excuſes, that they are acquitted as blameleſſe, held in good eſteeme, yea ſometimes prayſed and rewarded as innocent and well deſerving: yet let us reſt aſſured that by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſpeaking Truth, wee ſhall finde our ſelves gainers in the end. For firſt Truth it ſelfe is ſuch an unvaluable Jewell, that it is ſufficient to inrich its owners by it ſelfe, and to make full amends for all the inconveniences, diſadvantages, loſſes and puniſhments which they have by it; ſeeing it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the inward peace of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Spirituall joy in the aſſurance of Gods Love and our Salvation. Beſides it will make us acceptable unto God, who is in himſelfe alone All-ſufficient to reward our loving and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Truth in obedience to his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; and to recompence abundantly all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and diſadvantages which we have by it.

In which reſpects let us not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Jer. 9. 3.</note> ſtand for the Truth, but be valiant alſo in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and preſerving of it; ſeeing all that wee can doe or ſuffer, is not comparable unto thoſe benefits which we ſhall receive by it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing it hath beene ſhewed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>The ſecond uſe is that wee abborre lyes.</hi>
                  </note> to the convincing of all mens Conſciences not wilfully blinde, that lying is a moſt odious vice, diſhonourable unto God, and pernicious to our ſelves and neighbours; let us not upon any pretence of pleaſure or profit bee allured to like or love it; or if wee have formerly beene overtaken with it, yet let us not continue in it, but riſe out of this ſinne by unfained repentance. For howſoever heretofore our ignorance might make it the more excuſable, becauſe wee did not know that it is ſo odious unto God, ſo hainous in it ſelfe and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto us; yet now that the light of Truth hath laid it open in its owne colours and ſhape, if we ſtill make no conſcience of committing it, nor lay it to heart to bewaile, hate and turne from it by unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned repentance, wee ſhall be left unexcuſable, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17130:86"/> ſinning againſt the light of our owne knowledge, wee ſhall hereby aggravate our ſinne, and increaſe our puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Finally, ſeeing this vice is ſo hatefull and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>The third uſe is that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates ſhould indeavour by all meanes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this vice.</hi>
                  </note> and bringeth with it ſo many and great evils, both to private Perſons, and to all Families and Societies, Church and Common-wealth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life helliſh miſery, and eternall condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Let this moove all men in their ſeverall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and callings to uſe their beſt indeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this vice, and to amend and reforme it both in themſelves and others. And firſt, Magiſtrates ſhould be perſwaded to doe all they can to diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance this vice by making good lawes againſt it; and ſeeing them duely executed, becauſe it is no leſſe dangerous to a State, than any other vices, as being an incourager to all wickedneſſe, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and cover which doth conceale and hide it. And therefore as <hi>Plato</hi> thought thoſe Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes moſt miſerable, which abounded with Lawyers and Phyſitians, becauſe in them conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſuites, ſickeneſſes and diſeaſes abound al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; ſo may it much more truely bee ſpoken, that thoſe States and Kingdomes are moſt miſerable, in which lyes are moſt frequent without controule or puniſhment, becauſe it argueth plainely the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of all other vice, ſeeing their chiefe uſe is to cover all other ſinne, and incourage to all wickedneſſe, whilſt they promiſe to hide it. But eſpecially it muſt be the care of Governors and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to ſtoppe their eares to tale-bearers and lyars, becauſe it is the receivers that make theeves; and if they had no eare to liſten unto lyes, men would

               <p>But though the care of reforming this vice <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>The fourth uſe is, that wee doe our beſt to prevent this ſin in others.</hi>
                  </note> ought to be chiefly in Rulers and Magiſtrates, yet not in them onely; but every Chriſtian ought to doe his beſt to maintaine and nouriſh Trueth, and to ſuppres this Vice of lying both in himſelfe and others. Eſpecially it concernes every man to take heed, that hee ſo carry himſelfe in his entercourſe and dealings, that he be not a cauſe or occaſion unto his neighbor of falling into this ſin. And becauſe it is moſt frequently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in buying and ſelling, the Seller labouring to raiſe his commodity by telling untrueths, and the Buyer to pull downe the price by diſpraiſing it, therefore let us not only watch over our owne tongues that wee doe not offend, but alſo avoid all occaſions whereby our neighbour with whom we deale may fall into this ſinne. Now this is done when as wee doe not in driving our bargaine, delight in uſing many words which are ſeldome free from lyes, but take a plaine and faire courſe in our asking and offering with all convenient ſparingneſſe of ſpeech. And as the Seller is not by his laviſh prayſes to draw on the Buyer to ſpeake worſe of the commodity than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17130:87"/> it deſerves, or he thinkes, ſo let not the Buyer by his diſpraiſes, moove the Seller to uſe untrue commendations, that hereby hee may dazle his eyes, and allure him to a better liking. And as the one muſt not aske at the firſt exceſſive prices for his wares, from which height he doth not uſually deſcend to his ſelling price, but (as it were) by the ſteps and ſtaires of lyes and untruthes, ſo muſt not the other by too much hucking and niggardly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers as much under the juſt price, move him to the practice of his lying arts and eloquence; nor by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting his words when he ſpeaketh truth, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to further the bargaine by ſpeaking lyes, becauſe he ſeeth that the one is beleeved as well as the other.</p>
               <p>To conclude all that I have to ſay in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <note place="margin">§. 5. <hi>Tbat go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies ſhould doe their beſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe or reforme this vice in their inferiours.</hi>
                  </note> ſeeing this vice of lying is ſo ſinnefull and pernicious, let Parents and Governours of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies uſe their beſt care and indevour in the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their children, and governement of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to ſuppreſſe and reforme it by all good meanes, that thoſe under their charge be not tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and poyſoned with it. And to this end they muſt make themſelves in all their ſpeeches exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of truth unto their inferiours, and ſuch as hate and ſhunne lyes. In which reſpect I have much miſliked and condemned their practiſe which make no ſcruple of telling lyes to their little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, either by promiſing unto them that which they meane not to performe, that hereby they may allure them to doe what they would have them; or by skaring them with bug-beares and faiſe frights, that they may make them leave their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17130:88"/> crying, or doing other things amiſſe, whereby they uſually looſe their credit and authority with them, ſo that they doe not beleeve them when as they are ſerious in ſpeaking truth; and withall poyſon <note place="margin">Quo ſemel eſt imbuta recens ſervabit odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Teſta diu. <hi>Horat.</hi>
                  </note> their tender natures which in themſelves are too apt to receive any ſinnefull impreſſion, and make them apt and ready to follow their evill example, and ſo by cuſtome habituate them unto it, that they can hardly bee brought to leave it when they come to riper age. Another meanes is to make it one part of their chiefeſt care in obſerving their Children and Servants, that they may finde them out in their lyes, unto which by naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are ſo much inclined, and taking them with the manner, to rebuke and diſcountenance them in their ſinne, ſhewing them the hainouſnes of it by Gods Word, and the puniſhments which are threatned againſt them that are guilty of it. And if all this will not reclaime them, they muſt adde to their inſtructions and rebukes ſeaſonable correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſhew themſelves more ready and willing to remit or tenderly to chaſtize their faults com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt themſelves, than their ſin of lying, whereby they deny or excuſe them which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt God. Finally, if we would have our inferiours to confeſſe the truth when they are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and guilty, and not uſe lyes and falſe excuſes, we muſt in our government avoid too much rigor and cruelty in our corrections, which out of feare and infirmity will move inferiours to hide their faults with lyes, and ſo to hazard their ſoules rather than indure bodily ſmart, and rather to preſume on Gods mercy for the forgivenes of their ſins, than
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17130:88"/> to confeſſe them to ſuch governors as are ſo cruell, that they can expect from them no pardon of their fault, nor moderation in their puniſhments: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they would leave unto them ſome hope of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mercy upon their confeſſion and promiſe of amendment, if they would not alwayes deale with them in ſeverity and ſtrictneſſe of juſtice, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſome faults becauſe they are ſleight and venial, and ſome of an higher nature, becauſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity and truth, which moveth them by an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgement to ſubmit themſelves to their pleaſure, and to rely upon their mercy, they would not be ſo apt to make lyes their refuge, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they knew that they are ſo odious to their governours, that they will, if they be diſcovered, inflict upon them more certaine and ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And as rigour and cruelty muſt be ſhunned in correction: ſo alſo injuſtice and indiſcretion, whereby men make no difference of faults, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with as much ſeverity triviall and ſmall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights, as great and pernicious offences; infirmities and unwilling ſlips and faylings, as voluntary and wilfull negligences. For when the delinquent doth not lye under any great guilt, nor in his conſcience is convinced that hee hath deſerved much blame, and yet knowing in reſpect of his governours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion, that hee ſhall fare as ill as if hee were more faulty; this cauſeth him to make no ſcruple to prevent and eſcape his puniſhment by lyes: and becauſe theſe light faults happen often, and ſo the offender is put often to his lying ſhifts, at laſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome will bring an habite, and imbolden him to uſe lying excuſes to hide his greater faults, as well
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17130:89"/> as his leſſer faylings. The like care muſt bee uſed by Superiours in their corrections, that they avoid all raſhneſſe and furious paſſion; for if they come masked and diſguiſed under this terrible vizard and fall to execution before they have duely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and judged, they put the offender into a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fright, and not being able to ſee the face of his Father or Maſter, whileſt it is covered with this raſh rage and tyranny, for very feare hee denyeth the faults which he hath committed, before he well knoweth what hee ſpeaketh, and having once ſaid it, hee out-faceth the Trueth, and ſtoutly ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to his firſt lye, being ready to backe it with another; leſt if the Truth ſhould come to light he ſhould incurre more diſpleaſure, and draw upon himſelfe double puniſhment, both for his fault and falſhoode in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it with his lyes.</p>
